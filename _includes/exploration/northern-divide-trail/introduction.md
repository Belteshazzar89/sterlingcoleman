<h2><a href="northern-divide-trail/">Northern Divide Trail</a></h2>

The Northern Divide Trail is a planned trail which traverses the Northern Rocky Mountains in Northern British Columbia. It covers two subdivisions of the Canadian Rockies, the Hart Ranges and the Muskwa Ranges. From its Southern Terminus at Kakwa Lake, which is the Northern Terminus of the [Great Divide Trail][gdt] at Kakwa Lake, it goes Northwest to the Liard River, the official Northern boundary of the Rocky Mountains, and ends at Liard River Hot Springs.
