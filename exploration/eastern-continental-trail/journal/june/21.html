<p>I wasn’t exactly up early for my first morning on the International Appalachian Trail. An hour or two after sunrise I got up and packed up all my things, which were inconveniently lying all over the lean-to. I set out and got some water from the nearby brook.</p>

<p>Almost immediately I was back in the woods. Tall grass, mud, and an almost totally unused trail were on the menu for the first part of my day. I was able to follow along well enough, and never got off the trail very far. Wading through the trail, I encouraged myself with the knowledge that this terrain was not typical of the IAT, which others had described as largely road walking.</p>

<p>After an annoying ford or two, I delved deeper into the woods and met up with some old jeep or wagon trails, also little-used. The going was a little difficult at times because of this factor; the trail went along sloping hillsides that no one had trampled flat, or through dozens of fallen trees that will probably never be cleared.</p>

<p>Coming to an old fire warden’s cabin at the bottom of Deasey Mountain, I started ascending. I was not happy. The Appalachian Trail had shown me more mountains to climb than any person could ever want to climb, at least in one year. Nevertheless I climbed the steep trail and found another small building at the summit.</p>

<p>I persevered through the rest of the woods and finally came out to join some old logging road, which led to Lunksoos Lean-to. There was no log and the spot wasn’t beckoning me, so I didn’t even take a break there. More logging roads ensued, and I contentedly strolled them all, just happy to be out of the woods, though I was not away from the mosquitoes yet.</p>

<p>I came to the bridge to Bowlin Camps, and opted to go check it out. What a good move. The manager was super friendly, and let me take a shower and even charge my phone, though they used a generator to do it. As I talked to him I got a sense of the real solitude we were in out there in north central Maine. I even used a radio-relay telephone (I told you we were in the boondocks) to talk to Dick Anderson, the president of the IAT, to arrange a meet in the next couple of days.</p>

<p>Finally I got back on the trail, if that word indeed qualifies in this case. The logging road became tall grass, and very muddy. Basically I was hiking through a marsh, and the mosquitoes and black flies did not let me forget it. Determined to just keep moving, I made it to Grand Pitch Lean-to in the middle of the afternoon. It was a little early to stop, and I was sure the mosquitoes would be present the rest of the day and maybe even the night.</p>

<p>I hiked on, and the road became gravel again. I just kept going and going, past the not-very-nice-sounding Haskell Deadwater and on and on. Finally I got out past a gate. It was interesting to find that none of the roads I had hiked that day were accessible by car. Continuing on down the road, I got out to a paved road (!), and explored the area for a decent spot to sleep.</p>

<p>I walked over to the Matagamon Camps, but not before talking briefly to Baxter State Park Law Enforcement on his way home. I sat down at one of the sheltered picnic tables, and soon enough the guy I just talked to drives back and starts quizzing me on everything that I did at the park.</p>

<p>I don’t mind talking about my journey, but I get a little upset when someone out of their jurisdiction is taking notes on who I stayed with at Katahdin Stream Campground, etc. He also hurt my chances of being able to sneak into the campground by alerting the owners with his truck. When he left I sadly walked back a bit on the road, climbed up on a dirt bank and uncomfortably cooked dinner.</p>

<p>I settled on a gravel lot nearby. This worked out fine until after midnight, when it started raining on me. I hurriedly grabbed my stuff and jogged back to the sheltered table, where I arrived amid thunder, lightning, and a torrential downpour. Exasperated, I just tried to keep my stuff dry and get back to sleep.</p>
