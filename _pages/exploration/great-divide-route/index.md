title: Great Divide Route
---
The Great Divide Route is a mostly off-trail route between Kakwa Provincial Park, where the Great Divide Trail has its Northern Terminus, and Monkman Provincial Park, where the continental divide departs from the Rocky Mountains. My interest in the Great Divide Route is related to my interest in hiking North of the established trails in the Rocky Mountains, as the Great Divide Route is the first organized endeavor to continue hiking North in the Rockies, off-trail.

# Journal

My journal entries were written by hand on the back of paper navigation materials that I carried during my hike. Given that I had one sheet of paper to use per entry, my content was artificially limited to that space, although I feel I was able to accurately note my thoughts on my experience.

My writing style is quite dry and procedural compared to the eloquent and descriptive accounts which many other hikers have recorded. I find it difficult to remember all the major points in a long hiking day, and I hope that my journal atleast provides comprehensive coverage of the experience.

Each journal entry comes accompanied by some basic statistics, as well as a map with the recorded track of my hike, with the exception of Day 3 from Amisk Lake to Warner Lake, where my GPS receiver malfunctioned and I was only able to save the second half of the day's hike. The waypoints placed along the track are the same waypoints which I set before my hike, and used as reference points for myself.

# Commentary

A few weeks after the hike, I have put down notes, as detailed as I can make them, with more thoughts, recommendations, and any other insights which I think could be of use. This is meant to be a better description of each part of the hike, in the context of the whole trip.
