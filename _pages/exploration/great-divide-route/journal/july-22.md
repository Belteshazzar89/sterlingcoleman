Well, it was a really tough day today, but I know that I've been blessed. I woke up to a clear blue sky, what a treat!

Packing up a wet tent wasn't fun but I got it done and started the climb up to the pass above Amisk Lake. Somehow I climbed too high and had to deal with difficult terrain. I'm relying heavily on the GPS, I'm not too good at finding good hiking terrain on my own.

Descending to North Hendrick Creek was another challenging task. I fought to stay on the route, which was a steep descent among the small trees, with some rock scrambling thrown in for good measure.

I was at least pleased to find the creek easy to cross, not even getting my feet wet. The climb to Paksumo-Menagin Pass was boggy meadows, but by now I have learned that is as good as it gets.

Up at the pass, I saw a caribou up close! Over the pass, I had a clear view of the length of the valley I would traverse. The beginning was good hiking in the boggy meadows, but it got to be tough going closer to the lake.

It got worse as I climbed away fom the the lake and was constantly in thick bushes on the side of the valley, my feet contorting thsmselves, struggling for a foothold. I finally got done with that, and had easier hiking to the pass.

Descending towards South Warner Stream wasn't too bad either, and I saw a grizzly bear, about forty meters away. He ran, and I made noise while exiting the area.

It was big meadows as I advanced towards Warner Lake, but the terrain about two kilometers from the lake was very rough. I was tired and had serious trouble staying on the route. It took me forever to reach the lake, and morale was very low.

There isn't even a good spot to pitch a tent here! Oh well. The Lord has blessed me by keeping me from injury and letting me dry out two pairs of socks.
