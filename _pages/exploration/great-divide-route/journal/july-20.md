Wow, what a day! I woke up at Kakwa Cabin, and packed up. After a quick sweep of the cabin, I was out the door at 7. I got a picture of the GDT Northern Terminus, then found my way to the tote road.

It was often a bog. This would be a theme during the whole day. I avoided the water as best I could, counting on my waterproof socks to keep my feet dry.

I got lucky and spied the trail between the ponds, and took it. What a mess! It was completely overgrown and very difficult to follow. It was slow going, but I arrived at Jarvis Creek, and loved the simple beauty of the open meadow.

After a slight mix-up, I found the trail heading West on the North side of the Jarvis Lakes. Though sometimes a bog, it was not so bad, except when it went into a lake.

It took hours, but I made it to Jarvis Cabin. The logbook was incredible, lots of fun to read. After a short break, I left and found the trail heading West.

I lost it, then found it again, then lost it for good. The going was very tough, I had to keep my morale up.

Getting to the burn zone was a breath of fresh air. I climbed and thought I had found Moonias Lake, but was mistaken. It took awhile to get to Moonias Lake, and when I did I was determined to keep going.

A tough climb ensued, and I got a good sweat going but made it. I've descended down to Fay Lake, and have camped just beyond. Glad to be warm in my tent, and hoping my feet can go again tomorrow.
