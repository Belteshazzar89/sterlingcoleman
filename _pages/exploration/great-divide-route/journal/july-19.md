Writing from Kakwa cabin! Mark kindly dropped me off at the start of the Walker Creek FSR, and I started walking North. Taking care of my feet was the priority of the day, and probably the whole hike. It wasn't a lot of fun hiking on the Walker Creek FSR again, but I pushed on.

Just after passing the logging camp at kilometer marker 25, a truck pulled up and offered me a ride all the way to Bastille Creek! God has so blessed me today.

Normally I wouldn't accept a ride, but since I have already hiked to Bastille Creek, I didn't hesitate to accept. Luke and Rocky were on their way to pick up hikers coming out. I warned Luke about the poor road conditions approaching Bastille Creek, but he blazed ahead, providing some big bumps.

After a couple hours, we arrived and I thanked them profusely before hiking onwards. I thought I had a chance to hike to Kakwa Lake.

I soon met Father Ken and two other hikers, happy to be close to their pick-up spot. They reported Buchanan Creek to be a knee-deep ford. Heartened, I hiked on. The trail became impossibly wet, and I struggled to keep my feet dry. Making good time to Buchanan Creek, I took off my socks and barely made it across without incident, the water coming up to my waist.

From there I plowed on, stopping once or twice to inspect my feet. I made good time to Kakwa Lake, and met the lovely hosts. They kindly offered me tea, and we chatted about my hike and Kakwa. This is such a special place. Just getting here has been a little adventure.
