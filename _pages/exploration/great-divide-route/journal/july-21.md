Wow, what a tough day. I'm disappointed in the distance I made, but I gave a solid effort all day. Starting from near Fay Lake, I was able to follow meadows for a short distance, but pretty soon it was back to bushwhacking.

It was a little frustrating that I couldn't get down to the Narraway River sooner, but I kept plugging away. Navigation in the area close to the river was difficult, and I got turned around, wasting time.

When I finally did arrive, I was so happy to see the river was crossable. I didn't waste time fording over to a gravel bar, then finishing the crossing, getting cold water up to my waist.

With that done, I set off to climb towards Watin Pass. This turned out to be extremely difficult. I got going up the wrong creek, and had to change. There was big deadfall everywhere, and I was going at a snail's pace. I tried going up high to seek meadows, but they weren't going in the right direction. After an eternity, I found the upper reaches of the East side of the creek to be good meadows, and made my way to the pass.

After a short break, I was off to ford Belcourt Creek. This was another difficult task. Immense boulder fields awaited me, and after navigating those, I had to descend a very slippery slope. It had been raining very lightly most of the day.

Fording Belcourt Creek, I started another arduous bushwhacking session to climb to Amisk Lake. I was exhausted and morale was a little low when I arrived. Grateful to have a warm, dry place to rest.

Not looking forward to wet socks again. All my socks are wet, I need some sun to dry them out.
