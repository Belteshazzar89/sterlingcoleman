God has provided once again. I knew that today would be the roughest day of bushwhacking on the Great Divide Route based on previous accounts, so I promised myself to take it easy and not set my expectations too high. I thought if I could get to Framstead Creek, the worst of it would be behind me.

Straight out of Warner Lake was a climb through willows up to a pass where I was able to access better hiking. Passing the tarn, I made a tricky descent among willows and trees to Wapiti stream.

There were boggy meadows around the stream, so I made better time, crossing it and looking for the next climb. Truthfully, some of these descents and climbs are a blur in my mind, they are almost all willows.

Another tricky descent towards the South side of Tuck Lake started the worst of the bushwhacking. I took it slow, and with constant progress, advanced through the jungle. I couldn't tell you where exactly I was going, just that I was faithfully following the line on my GPS.

From Tuck stream to Framstead Creek was tough, but I made it eventually. By mistake I crossed the wrong branch of the creek and had to cross another to get back on the route.

It was getting late as I fought my way through the thick bush, but I found some boggy meadows which sped things up. Praying for a spot to set up my tent before dark, I came across another meadow and found a spot that was not so wet. I'm safe and dry, happy to be past a difficult day.
