God has been good to me on Day 1.

I woke up at the motel and sent a message to Mark after realizing that I had too much food (somehow). Poor Mark has been so helpful in getting me everything I need. Leaving the food at the motel desk, I got down to the train station, where I realized I didn't have ID to get on the train. The attendant was nice and let me get on anyway. The train was delayed, but I made it to Dome Creek by 11:30.

I officially started my hike walking the tracks. I was nervous as I passed a train idling on a side track, but I wasn't called out for being on the tracks. The hiking got more difficult as I left the tracks to follow a powerline right-of-way, overgrown with wet bushes.

God blessed me by sending out a crew on an ATV to fix a downed line. Their ATV made the hike bearable by flattening the overgrowth a bit. It took awhile, but I made it to the road, and after a slight mix-up, crossed the Fraser River heading North.

There isn't much to report from there. I just kept going on the Walker Creek FSR, advancing to the North. As time went on, I became aware of big blisters on both feet which grew quite painful. I toughed it out for as long as I could, and when I got somewhat close to my goal for the day, set up my tent in a muddy spot next to a logging operation.

Though it was a very tough introduction, God blessed me with water when I needed it, and a spot to sleep when I could go no further.
