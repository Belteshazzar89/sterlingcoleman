The hike was over and I had seen the Viking site at L'Anse aux Meadows. Now lying on my hotel bed, I didn't really want to do anything. At some point I had considered seeing the properties belonging to Dr. Grenfell, who was famous for providing medical help to the fishing communities in Northern Newfoundland and Southern Labrador. Now I didn't care to do that, and just wanted to lie on the bed until it was time for me to go home.
So my day was spent mostly lounging around watching television and surfing the web. There was a grocery store across the street from the hotel. A real grocery store, the kind I hadn't seen since Corner Brook, and I happily went there to get some junk food to eat throughout the day.

Back in my room, I didn't bother to adventure outside again. I ate and watched television, and got ready to leave the next day. I had been ready to go back to the States for a matter of weeks, and I was getting very close to leaving the mysterious island of Newfoundland.
