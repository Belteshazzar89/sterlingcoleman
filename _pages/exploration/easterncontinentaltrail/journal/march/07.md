Kevin and I slept in a bit, because the camper felt pretty cozy. Once we got up we got ready and Kevin did a quick rundown of his gear. I offered to carry his sleeping bag since his gear was heavy camping gear.

We started down the trail and enjoyed the scenery of the wooded hills. Thankfully the route was easier than the rock gardens I had previously trekked. Though we had to take breaks occasionally, Kevin handled the hike quite well.

It was great to talk to an old friend while I walked. Kevin had been in Asia for a couple of years, so we enjoyed sharing the experience of doing something different and adventurous.

We saw some cool cascades and a few other hikers heading the opposite direction. After crossing a county road we came upon a stream with a large campsite. We settled there and got a good campfire going, which I don't usually have.

We did some good backpacking cooking, and enjoyed each other's company. Finally we slept in Kevin's big Kelty tent, which was different for me too.
