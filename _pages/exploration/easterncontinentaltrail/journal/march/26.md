I got up early and got my things packed up, leaving the shelter before most other hikers. The trail took me up Albert Mountain, which was a steep climb with a fire tower at the peak. I was disappointed to find the hatch at the top of the stairs locked, but not too much since I don't particularly enjoy being in tall structures on top of mountains.

From there the trail was almost completely downhill, and I did not use up too much energy as I half jogged down each switchback. I caught up with another hiker from Carter Gap Shelter, and because we went at approximately the same pace he ended up shadowing me for several miles. I have to admit that I was not really keen on having someone hiking right behind me after traveling alone for nearly two thousand miles.

We found a hiker box, but sadly there was little inside. I left my coincidental companion to rummage through it while I moved on. Not too many miles later, I reached Winding Stair Gap, where I came across my first real Trail Magic.

A man and his grandsons were giving hikers barbecue sandwiches, chips, drinks, and other snacks. I ended up scarfing down three sandwiches because they were so delicious.

After that I didn't eat for awhile, choosing to let my parking lot meal extend my food supply for a bit. I moved up the hills towards another tower, this one made of stone. Upon arriving, I took a panorama of the scene and talked briefly with another hiker, who decided to join me in hiking to the next shelter.

We had about two hours to cover a little over five miles, and we made good time. I enjoyed hearing of travels to Central and South America by my new companion, whose fianc√© was from Venezuela. He was going to Las Cruces, New Mexico, after finishing the trail in order to be with her while she pursued a doctoral degree.

We arrived at a full shelter with a little time before dark, and started scoping out the camping areas. I settled on a spot up on a hill, and hoped it would not be too windy. I picked up some water, cooked my food, and went to bed.
