I left my hotel in Blue Ridge refreshed and ready to tackle the Benton MacKaye Trail once again. However, I was not about to go back to the beginning, so I started walking towards the trailhead on Weaver Creek Road.

Soon I was hailed by a driver who offered to give me a ride. I met Mark, who was a member of the Benton MacKaye Trail Association, and very helpful. He took me all the way to Shallowford Bridge, even farther than I had hoped!

Finally heading in the correct direction on the trail, I found the same steep climbs and descents. Still making decent time, I passed a cool fire tower. Water was not very abundant on the trail, and I had to drink a lot at the source and carry less away because of the weight and the tough terrain.

I determined that I could reach Little Skeenah Creek before dark, and did so. I got there with enough time to go for water at the closed Huntin' & Fishin' Headquarters, where I was surprised to meet the owner. He was from Newfoundland, and talked of polar bears and icebergs at the end of my journey, which was exciting.

Back at my camp, I tried unsuccessfully to start a good fire, then went to bed. Another day on the cursed Benton MacKaye Trail awaited me, and I was beat.
