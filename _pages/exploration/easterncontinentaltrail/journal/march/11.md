From Oakey Mountain Shelter I knew that I would be crossing into Georgia. My walk for the day took me out of the Talladega National Forest and into the Indian Mountain area. I walked on the bike trail past the showers, and went on to Davis Mountain, which was distinctive in that almost all the trees had been cleared off of it.

I noticed that the log at Davis Mountain Shelter had a bunch of anti-Christian gibberish put there by an ECT thru-hiker named Vittles. To be clear, that type of thing only happens to you when you do the ECT Southbound.

Moving on, I got to the Alabama/Georgia state line, and moved down to the shelter just below. I sat there and pondered going to Cave Spring that night, and finally went for it.

Pretty soon I was out of the woods and walking dirt roads. I noticed that the road walk was not the fastest route to Cave Spring, but I did it anyway. There were plenty of good spots to stealth camp along the way, but I was set on getting into town.

I made the final few miles on the highway roll by quickly, and soon I was in Cave Spring. Unfortunately, nothing was open at ten at night, so I snuck into Rolater Park and settled down in one of the picnic shelters. No one seemed to notice me for the rest of the night.
