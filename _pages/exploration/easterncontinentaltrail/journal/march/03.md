I took an anticipated zero day at Blister Bob's house. It felt great to have the Alabama Roadwalk done, and my interest in the Pinhoti was growing as I listened to Bob's vast knowledge of all the different portions of the trail in Alabama.

More good food ensued, and I got to Skype a friend in Bangkok whom I had talked to a month prior. We cleaned Bob's vehicles, and he took me to the Cheaha Mountain Store to get postcards, which I could not find anywhere else.

Being with a couple of fellow hikers was fun for me. I could tell that they had really enjoyed their time with Lakeland, and I only hoped that I was of a similar interest to them. I pigged out on some junk food and prepared to hit the trail the next day. My bed felt great for the second night in a row.
