My spot on the overlook held up well, and in the morning I got an early start down past Keown Falls. I wanted to go to Dalton to get some hot food.

The falls were interesting, and so was my route. I enjoyed being on a real footpath for most of the day, but wished that I didn't have to turn South for another mountain or two.

I saw plenty of water in a low area between mountains, and even a teepee at a little campsite that someone had set up with lots of firewood.

I got my fair share of mountain climbing and ridge walking, from which I could see miles and miles. I was happy to come over a ridge and see Interstate 75, the first interstate highway that I crossed down in Florida.

The walk from there still took a few hours, but I enjoyed the radio towers and the peculiar little dirt road down to Dug Gap. On my way into town I signed up for free chips and queso at Chili's, which I then ordered over the phone. I was very happy, and stuffed silly after a burger and all those chips.

My plan was originally to stealth camp in town, but when I saw a cheap hotel I went for it. I hoped that I wasn't going too soft, but a bed and a television felt great after beating a fever and long road walks.
