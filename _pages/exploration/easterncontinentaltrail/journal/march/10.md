A decently early start out of Laurel Shelter helped to get me down the trail fast and on to Shoal Creek Church, one of very few hewn log churches in Alabama. I took some pictures and saw some graves of former Confederate soldiers.

Continuing on, I passed a family camping near the Choccolocco Creek Watershed. The scenery was the typical wooded hills, broken up by a couple of dams. At the second dam, I passed three younger guys taking a break. I set on, hoping to get to Oakey Mountain Shelter.

I arrived there with time before dark, and so I cooked up some food and gathered firewood. My campfire went well, although it seemed like I was smoking out the shelter. A couple of ATVs went up the mountain for the sunset, then came down after dark and drove right up to the shelter which I didn't appreciate. With them gone, I settled into my sleeping bag in the shelter and went to sleep.
