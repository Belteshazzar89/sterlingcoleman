I woke up and did not get an early start. After sluggishly packing up I headed down the mud pit that used to be an ATV trail before the thunderstorm that hit in the night.

Hopping around the mud puddles in the ATV ruts, I finally made it to the real trail after fording a creek and generally taking longer than I thought I would. I tried to eat some, but didn't feel that hungry.

After walking in the mountains for some time, I started to suspect that I was sick. I had been drinking a lot of water, but my forehead felt a little hot. I tried to get a ride set up, but couldn't make it happen. Feeling pretty bad and not enthusiastic about another day of walking, I camped by a stream and tried to sleep.
