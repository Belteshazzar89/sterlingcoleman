I woke up and had a little breakfast before getting ready for church. Dave and Debbie took me with them, and I got to meet a lot of very nice folks, many of whom knew about the Appalachian Trail. I even got to meet Dave's sister, who came down to visit him since he returned to the states.

After the service there was a potluck, so I had plenty of good food, including many cookies for dessert. We then returned to the house, where we chatted for a bit before I packed up my things, got my new shoes from the mail, and Debbie gave me a ride back to Deep Gap, even granting my request for ice cream in town before returning to the trail.

Sad to leave my new friends, but happy to be on the trail with my pack mended and my shoes replaced, I hiked up past Standing Indian Mountain, and on for a few hours until I arrived at Carter Gap Shelter, which was of course full.

I set up my tarp and hung out with other hikers around the fire before retiring for the evening. I had not covered many miles in the past couple of days, but was now refreshed and ready to tackle the trail once again.
