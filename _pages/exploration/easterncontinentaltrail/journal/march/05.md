My camp got a little windy, but my tarp held firm throughout the night. In the morning I left, and got down and passed through my first real Pinhoti Trailhead, Bull Gap.

The trail got higher than I had been before, and I could see for a long way from a power line and Sherman Cliffs. I enjoyed a full day on a mountain trail, and found that it was well-maintained.

There were signs with reference distances at many of the forest road crossings as well as the trailheads. After passing Porter's Gap, I determined that I could do a few more miles before making camp.

I crossed Talladega Creek, then made my way to the top of a hill, where I settled at a small campsite. I found that there was little flat ground, even for my small tarp. I made a place away from the fire ring and enjoyed some hot food at night.
