Kevin and I woke up and got some more food cooking in the morning by the fire. We still got going fairly early, and continued the hike.

I carried Kevin's sleeping bag again, and the weight was starting to get to me a bit since I was not used to it. There was not quite as much to see as the day before, but more of the ups and downs along the sides of the hills.

Though our plan was to do about fourteen miles and have Blister Bob give us a ride back to Kevin's camper, we called Bob early because we were tired. We met him on Alabama 281 just after moving through an area hit by a tornado a few years ago and then harvested for the remaining trees.

It was good to see Bob again, and we were grateful for the ride. Though I had hoped to see Bob again later, he had other plans, so Kevin and I picked up some groceries in town then found a secluded spot to park the camper in the mountains.

Hanging out with Kevin in the camper for another night suited me just fine, and we had a good time until hitting the sack late at night.
