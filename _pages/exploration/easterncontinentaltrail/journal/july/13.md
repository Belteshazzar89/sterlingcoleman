Another great night at the Hotel Mac. I was sleeping on an air mattress, but it was still great. I could take showers any time I wanted, and there was fast food within a few miles that we visited fairly frequently.

At breakfast we got to see my aunt and uncle, as well as my cousin and his girlfriend. They had all come in the previous afternoon. Afterwards we went out to get some laundry done and to look for a jacket for me at a thrift store. I found a good one and we got our laundry done.

We messed around in town and at the hotel until it was time for dinner. We headed over to my cousin's house for a rehearsal dinner, since her wedding was the next day. All of the groom's family was there, and it was good to meet a few new people as well as see my cousin Emelie (the bride).

Her house was right on the bay and had a good view, though the bay breeze might have been a bit chilly. We had some great food and I got to talk to a lot of different folks. Navied, the groom, has family from central Asia, so it was fun to hear about a different culture.

Eventually it got late and we headed back to the hotel. It had been fun to see everyone, but also tiring for me since I was not used to being around a lot of people. The air mattress was a suitable end to such an evening.
