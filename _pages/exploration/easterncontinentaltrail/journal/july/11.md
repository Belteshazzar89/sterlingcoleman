I woke up early and found someone sleeping right next to me on the bench. I packed up my things and went to check in for my flight. Everything went smoothly. The large line at security was nothing to worry about, and I was through in no time.

I went through customs in Montreal and was on to the gate. Customs at the airport is much less stringent than customs at the border, probably because you go through security first anyway. I was sitting at the gate an hour or two before take-off. All was well and I was set to fly to California.

I was strangely not bothered by having to take three separate flights to get to San Francisco (stopping in Dallas and Los Angeles). On my flight to Los Angeles, someone mentioned that Keith Urban, a famous country music star in whom I am not particularly interested, was on the flight. Having never been west of Texas, it was fun to be in California.

Arriving in the bay area, my parents picked me up and we headed out into the heavy traffic. I enjoyed seeing the bay and just being in California. I got to see my brother at the hotel and we all hung out there before grabbing a quick dinner and heading to bed.
