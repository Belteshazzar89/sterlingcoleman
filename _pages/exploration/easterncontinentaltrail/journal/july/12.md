I woke up at the Hotel Mac in Point Richmond, where we were staying. In general Richmond is not a particularly ritzy place, but Point Richmond is nice. We walked across the street for breakfast, which was great.

Afterwards we did plenty of lounging around, but then headed out to do some Geocaching. I used to geocache a lot before I started my trek. It is a simple treasure hunting game based on GPS coordinates which has spread across the globe.

We picked a geocache on top of a hill. My mother and I took our time climbing up the steep service road. It felt great not to have to worry about rushing up a hill, or even making it to the top at all. I enjoyed hearing about fond memories she had of a similar hill in the Panama Canal Zone, and just spending time with my family.

We got lunch at a local Mexican restaurant, then hung out for the rest of the day. I was living the off-the-trail life and loving it. My brother and I shared a Huge Everest pizza at Xtreme Pizza, which was incredible, then we all went back to the hotel to lay down, one of my favorite activities. Soon it was bedtime and another totally hike-free day had passed.
