Well rested, Stinger and I enjoyed the morning in the motel and I got some laundry done. We left right at checkout time and left town with somewhat-healed feet.

Walking the dike is not terribly interesting, considering that there is almost never a view of the lake, which is on the other side of a big marsh.

Since we left late we knew we weren't going to cover too much ground, and after leaving Moore Haven, darkness approached. We followed a single figure in the dim light, wondering if a homeless man was headed for our anticipated campsite.

The man stopped short and turned out to be a hiker. We spoke briefly and he warned of dangerous boat rides to Belle Isle in Newfoundland.

It got dark and we walked on, looking for the camp. When we thought we were in the right spot we couldn't see anything. Finally we noticed a sign pointing off the trail.

The cold got worse as we approached the site so we retreated to higher ground and got set up in the dark. It was very cold, and I tossed and turned all night.
