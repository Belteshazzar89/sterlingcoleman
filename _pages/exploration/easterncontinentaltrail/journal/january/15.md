I woke up with frost on my sleeping bag. The night was frigid and I had not slept much. It was difficult to get going because of the cold, but we hit the trail on the dike eventually.

The walking was boring, we just walked along the dike pretty much all day and didn't hit any real towns. We got passed then repassed the hiker we had seen the day before.

That was the only person we saw, besides a lock keeper (?) whose job it is to operate a lock to manage boats and water level in the lake which we hardly ever even saw.

Oddly the view was mostly of land and swampland from the dike. The lake was usually not within eyesight. When we got to Indian Prairie Camp we stopped a little early for the day.

I got some hot food cooked, which was great. Sitting around at camp is a lot of fun since I spend almost all my time walking throughout the day.
