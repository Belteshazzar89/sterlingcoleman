After an exhausting day of preparation on New Year's Eve, I woke up before four in the morning to get to the airport. There was a bad wreck (surprise!) on the way but I still made it on time.

I slept some and talked to a nice girl on the flight to Key West from Miami-Dade, which I barely made. The Key West airport is lovely and quaint, but the fun stopped when half my gear didn't show up in Key West. I got a paper from the desk and visited the Southernmost Point in the Continental USA, then came back to see if my bag had arrived. No dice.

I continued the trail out of Key West, which is the quintessential small beach town, and does have a few chickens on the loose. With a lighter bag than expected, I was determined to take advantage of my airway's sponsored slackpacking.

My bag came in and so I requested delivery on my route. I later got a message that the bag couldn't be delivered until tomorrow around noon, meaning I get to sleep in if I want!

I should mention that the Keys and their winter climate are outstanding. Swamp lovers will be in heaven, but there are plenty of good beaches in and near Key West.

Time to rest my feet now.
