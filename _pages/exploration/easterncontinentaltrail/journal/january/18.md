Stinger and I left our camp by the Kissimmee River and headed out. We didn't see the river at all the rest of the day, which was a bit of a bummer.

We covered a good bit of forest and swamp during the day. Included was a long walk along a fence line for a hunting ranch, through broken up terrain and tall grass. Finally that was over and we enjoyed High Bridge, which goes over a little water, and then a lot of long boardwalks which cover swamp. I was very grateful not to be doing a Big Cypress swampwalk all over again.

After more road walking and finding some much-needed water, we continued on back into the woods and swamps, called hammocks. We settled in at Mosquito Hammock Camp before dark. Thankfully the skeeters weren't any worse than we had already experienced.

I had avoided rain all day, but now the sky was dark and cloudy. After getting a few drops I switched from on top of a picnic table to underneath. Of course the rain was pretty much over at that point, but I stayed down there the remainder of the night.
