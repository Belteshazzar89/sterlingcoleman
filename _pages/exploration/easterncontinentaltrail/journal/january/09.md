Wow, what a walk today. Mr. Jones dropped me off early at Coopertown and I headed West. The road was long, but after a break at the Native American gas station, I hit Loop Road.

I tried not to get my hopes up, but after hitting Loop Road so early I thought about the possibility of starting the Florida Trail that day. I didn't have a clue how far the trail was from me.

Loop Road didn't seem too far on the map, but in practice it took hours and hours to walk to the Southern Terminus of the Florida Trail. I was lucky to get water at the Loop Road Environmental Education Center, and kept walking. It got dark and I was still looking for the start of the Florida Trail.

Finally I spotted it and went to sleep right there. Tomorrow I would hit a real trail.
