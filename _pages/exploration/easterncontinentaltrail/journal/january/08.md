I'm taking another zero day. It's tough to hit the trail knowing how heavy the pack is going to be. I got to go to church in Key Largo and see William and other folks I had met there Wednesday, and I got to watch some football; though I didn't see my Texans whoop up on the Bengals.

Tomorrow I will get back on the trail.
