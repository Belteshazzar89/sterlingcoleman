Today I finally hit the trail again, starting from where the Joneses picked me up two days prior. The route was simple but long, and I got to see a lot of farm land. I was tempted to stop at Grandma's fruit stand for a Strawberry Milkshake but I declined.

I picked up trail groceries for the first time. The pack felt quite heavy after loading up the food, and I was able to get Mr. Jones to pick me up again once I made it to a place called Coopertown.

I put in some good miles, but I need to do a better job of taking care of my feet.
