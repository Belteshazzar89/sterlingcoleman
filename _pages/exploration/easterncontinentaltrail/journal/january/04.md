After a great day on the trail, I discovered during the night that my Air Core had punctures that I couldn't successfully patch up. To make it worse I was sleeping in a rock field.

I had breakfast at Burger King, which felt manufactured, but I was able to refill my water.

I enjoyed walking along on land as opposed to bridges. Most of the route was on the path called the Florida Overseas Heritage Trail, which spans the Keys.

Arriving in Key Largo, I anticipated going all the way to the end of US 1 in Key Largo until I passed by a church with a service in a couple of hours. I stopped to rest, made a phone call or two, then stayed warm until the service.

I'm sure William was interested in the bundle in a sleeping bag on the church's front porch when he opened up the church. Very friendly, he let me in and I cleaned up and met the folks who attend this small church.

I enjoyed the service, which was led with a good bit of intelligent thought and discussion. I wish church was always that way. Afterwards William let me stay at his house, which was next door.

I enjoyed talking with him about my experience in the automotive software industry and getting to know him, and also his brother Frank.

I slept on the floor, and it was the best sleep I had so far this year.
