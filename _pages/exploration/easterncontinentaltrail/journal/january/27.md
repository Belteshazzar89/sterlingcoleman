I got up rather late as the rain continued to fall. The couch was extremely comfortable, and it was tough to get up. I messed around on the computer in the morning, using it as an excuse not to hike in the rain, which was supposed to end before noon. Finally it seemed to have stopped so I bid my gracious hosts farewell and set out to hike the Ocala National Forest.

The rain started again, and though it was light, I was not pleased. I think that it must have made me walk very fast, however, because I checked my progress at one point and was very pleased.

I wanted to put myself in position to make it to the 88 Store the next day, so I didn't take too many breaks and was able to do thirty miles before I decided I was ready to lie down for the night.

A cold front must have come it after the rain, because it got uncomfortably cold at night. I didn't get much sleep, and was looking forward to meeting up with the Western Corridor and going to the store.
