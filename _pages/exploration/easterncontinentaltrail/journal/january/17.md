As a couple of early morning boaters came to the boat launch, Stinger and I got ready to head out. It was not long before we crossed the first stile over a fence on the Florida Trail.

The route covered a lot of open fields and cow pastures. The cows took the liberty of staring as we walked by and through them. Part of the route was closed due to incompletion, which was lucky because it was a swamp.

We got our fair share of road walking in and then got back to the Kissimmee. The camp we settled at could have been better. We could tell people not thru-hiking the Florida Trail had used the camp, as used toilet paper was lying around. Another problem was realized when Stinger went to the river for water and came back to report there was a big bog between us and the river. He eventually went back and got soaked just for a bottle of water.

I went to sleep looking forward to getting away from the road the next day and hopefully into the forest.
