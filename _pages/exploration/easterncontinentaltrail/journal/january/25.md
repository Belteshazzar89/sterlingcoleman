Waking up early was imperative to avoid alarming anyone using the Cross Seminole Trail in the morning. I got packed up and only a couple runners saw me before I was out on the trail again.

Well rested, I walked the trail out of Oviedo and into Winter Springs, where I stopped for a late breakfast at Billy's Cafe. Of course, my server's brother was going to start the Appalachian Trail in March. Future hikers are everywhere.

I kept on walking and was excited to see The Senator, a 3500 year old cypress tree in Big Tree Park. When I got there the park was closed, and there was a sign out front that said 'RIP Senator'. I talked to a maintenance man and he explained that the tree got hit by lightning and fell over, catching fire, just a few days prior. I couldn't believe I had missed a 3500 year old tree by a few days.

I stopped for more food a couple of times, getting turned around but not worrying about putting a lot of miles in. I had hoped to call a church to get a shower from a member of a church nearby, but the places I called were disorganized and unenthusiastic about helping a brother out, so I decided to leave town.

By nighttime I crossed Interstate 4, and stopped at a Moe's, where I met Marco and Thomas, a couple of cool Brothers in the Lake Mary area. I had some good food and enjoyed talking with them, but I got tired and eventually had to leave to find a spot to sleep. Good to meet you guys, and look forward to hearing from you later on.

I left and walked along the Cross Seminole Trail, soon finding a secluded spot in the woods to lay down. I kept feeling itchy, but I couldn't identify any mosquitos, and only a couple of stray ants. I got to sleep eventually.
