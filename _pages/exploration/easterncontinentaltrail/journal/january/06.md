I have decided to take my first zero day today. After not being ready to leave until eleven in the morning, I just could not pass up staying at the Jones house.

Tonight I will learn more about cooking on the trail, which is very important. The Joneses know way more about trail life than I do, and it is rather daunting being unprepared to answer so many of their questions. Better now than on the trail, I guess.
