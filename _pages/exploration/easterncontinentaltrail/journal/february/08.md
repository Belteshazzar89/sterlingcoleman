I woke up late and Karen cooked us up some eggs. Did I mention that Karen is the definition of a trail angel? I continued to eat through all the junk food that I bought, and we hung out at the camp doing various chores. I took another hot shower because they feel so good.

The whole day was pretty much a blur. I just basked in the glory of a second straight day off of the trail in a place that I loved.

In the back of my mind I was thinking about all this time I was taking off of the trail, but I truly was enjoying Holton Creek. My package finally came in to Gibson Park, and I retrieved it gladly.

A kayaker came in and we talked a bit and picked him up a six pack at a store. He was very nice, and from the same state I grew up in. Karen cooked us up some more great food (steak!!), and she and I watched The Hangover Part 2 at night. Not the greatest, but it had its moments.

I went to bed ready to hit the trail the next day.
