I got a fairly early start and made my way to Luverne through Mount Ida. The walk into town only took a couple of hours because I had positioned myself so close the night before.

Getting into Luverne, I spent some time at fast food restaurants recharging my iPhone and pigging out. I asked around town for postcards, but no one sells postcards anymore. At the post office I picked up some anticipated mail, though they said they don't usually do general delivery.

I walked out of town and hit a convenience store in Rutledge before beginning the long walk north to Montgomery. I was getting pretty sick of the Alabama Roadwalk already and I was only about halfway through it.

I used my music to help pass the time, but it just took hours to move north, and I hit Highland Home before dark. I stopped at a Subway (!) and had another great sub, then moved through the town as darkness fell.

Once in the Lapine area I decided that I was not in the mood for another road walk, and found a decent spot to set up camp. My night walking days were swiftly ending, as they were not particularly fun. I tried to sleep, knowing I had a long walk in store the next day.
