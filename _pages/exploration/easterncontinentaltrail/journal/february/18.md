Bennett took me into Blountstown to pick up mail from the Post Office, then back to Camel Lake. It was not raining, so I started walking immediately. I finished up the woods in little time and started the road walk I had already seen in the car several times.

I listened to music to help the time pass, and counted down the miles to Bristol. On the outskirts of Bristol someone in a house I passed fired off four quick shots with a handgun. They weren't aimed at me, but I was sure that they were supposed to be a warning to me that this person would defend themselves against even the mildest and least dangerous hikers.

Later on, a deputy ID'd me because he didn't recognize me. I let him know I wasn't too happy about it, and he explained that there had been a rash of home invasions in the area. Finally I reached Bristol. No real rain had hit me, and I walked on in very light drizzle.

Near the bridge to Blountstown a little heavier rain hit, but soon stopped altogether. It felt like it took forever, but I reached Blountstown and went for the funnily-named Piggly Wiggly for groceries, then Burger King.

There I met Ed and Jackie, who were interested in my travels and offered to let me stay the night with them in Bristol. I gladly accepted.
