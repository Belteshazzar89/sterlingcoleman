I was late in departing, partly because I was in some pain from the night time raid performed on my right hand by the fire ants. I continued on through the forest, walking along the familiar dirt forest roads occasionally.

I had hoped for an electrical outlet at Porter Lake Campground, but was not so lucky. I did get water there, and talked to a guy who had seen Stumpknocker and Mrs. Gorp there that very morning.

I got to see more of the familiar forest, and got closer to finishing up my final Florida National Forest. I crossed the New River at the Vilas area, got off of the state highway, then looked for a spot to sleep. I picked an unused dirt road that now was being used for a stretch of trail, and was sure not to camp near fire ants.
