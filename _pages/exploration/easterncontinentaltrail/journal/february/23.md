I woke up ready to hit the trail and get into Crestview. I still had a significant walk through Eglin Air Force Base. The northern edge of the base was nicely forested and had some hills, a good reminder that I was heading north.

Though the forest was lovely, I could almost always hear the noise of a major road. I thought that this was Interstate 10, but then realized that other, smaller roads were the source of the noise some of the time.

The miles flew by, and soon I was nearing the highway. From there it was just a short walk north, under Interstate 10 for the last time. I lounged around various fast food restaurants (and Crestview has them all), then eventually got a few groceries at Walmart. Someone gave me twenty dollars there... I think it's the beard.

I ate an entire large pizza on my way out of town, and walked on through the downtown area, which was a nice change of pace. There were not any obvious spots to camp so my trek continued out of Crestview and almost to the Yellow River before I settled on a spot in the woods just off of the road. It was very late at night, so I got to sleep fast in order to be ready to walk again in the morning.
