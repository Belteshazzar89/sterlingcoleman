I woke up and got my stuff together. I was not in a hurry because I was only going to Holton Creek, where I would camp in wait for the return of my lost data book at Gibson Park.

The walk was a continuation of the roller coaster along the river as I traversed all of the little creeks and ditches that feed into the Suwannee.

It sprinkled for about two minutes, similar to the day before. Rain had been forecast as a possible chance for the past few days, but never really came.

I eventually arrived at the camp, where I set up in one of the shelters and took a nice hot shower. The new host's camper was there but she was not.

Soon she came back and I formally met Karen, who I had seen at the visitor center a few days prior. She was extremely nice, and offered me all sorts of help. She fed me some hot soup for dinner (!) and gave me a big blanket. I felt great as I slept nice and warm in the shelter, away from the bugs.
