I decided that I would take a day off of hiking and get myself together in Hot Springs. It was nice to hang out with Lakeland, Chuck, and many AT hikers staying at the Laughing Heart.

I got to use the computer at the library and have a couple of great meals at the diner with Lake. We enjoyed sitting underneath a photo of the old Eastern Continental Trail at Cap Gaspe, signed by Nimblewill Nomad.

We chatted more with Chuck Norris about the Florida Trail and our journey far north. Just before dinner Tigger arrived, and it was great to meet her. Chuck, Tigger, Lake and I all went to the diner and had a great meal.

I made sure that I was well stocked on junk food, and I even ate a bunch of bananas from Hillbilly Market. Eventually it was time for bed, and I went to sleep after eating my second three-eighths of a gallon of ice cream.
