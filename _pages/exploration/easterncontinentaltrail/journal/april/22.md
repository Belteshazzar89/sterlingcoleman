The weather did not look particularly dry on Sunday, and I already had the notion that I did not want to hurry back to the trail immediately. I went to the church I used to attend, where few people recognized me at first.

It was great to see a lot of people that I had not seen in a few years, especially my friend Andy, who took me to an incredible Chinese buffet after church. I ate all that I could and felt a little sick afterwards.

The whole day off was a blessing. I hung out with Andy for hours and attempted to help him speed up his computer. If you are reading this journal with Windows Vista and one gigabyte of RAM, you will understand his dilemma.

I returned home and enjoyed the comforts of the big couch once more, and even played some video games with my brother. Going to bed late again, I wondered if I was getting a little too used to this other lifestyle, but I did not feel that the two worlds were very separate.
