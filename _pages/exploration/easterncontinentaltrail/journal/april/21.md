In the morning the cat owner found a pummeled mouse next to her head. This is the problem with cats: sometimes they do not have the courtesy to eat their prey. I left pretty early because I was anxious to get to town, as always.

The miles to town went fast, except for the last mile into town. The last mile into town is always the longest. I finally arrived and went to the grocery store for some ice cream before heading to a fast food restaurant to charge my phone.

My father met me there and we went to Shoney's breakfast buffet, which was good. I was worried about the rain and was a little tired of hiking after covering over seventy five miles in two days. Because the whole weekend looked like rain, I opted to go to my parents' house in Charlottesville to stay for at least one night.

It felt great to be home. I had plenty of food, relaxed, and even played some video games. I got to see my brother as well, and stay up late! It was like being a kid again.
