More rain seemed likely, and my dad could not return me to the trail in the morning due to a dentist appointment. I hung out at the house, playing video games. I had been thinking about games on the trail, but after playing for a few days I could handle leaving them behind for the rest of the trip.

I got ready to go and had a nice lunch with my dad at Chili's before leaving town. On the drive down to Daleville I felt tired, and napped off and on until we neared our destination.

We had to stop at a weigh station to pick up a bag of valuables I had lost in Daleville, recovered by a state trooper. In Daleville my dad dropped me off and I started down the trail once again.

At the next road crossing I came across Metro North! I was glad to see him, and we hiked together for a couple of miles until we met his friend Jay, who was hiking with him for a few days. I went ahead to the first shelter and arrived before dark. Metro North and Jay got there a little later and we were the only occupants.
