The forecast was rain again, but the next day looked better. I decided to take one last day off and start hiking again the next day. This time, however, I didn't want to just sit at the yard all day and watch metal get crunched, cut up, and shipped off.

Eric and I grabbed our usual breakfast and went to the yard. I did end up hanging out there until lunch, when we got sandwiches from the same local store in Monticello, a town whose name is sadly not pronounced like Thomas Jefferson's estate.

In the afternoon Eric took some of his guys to his other work site, and I asked to be dropped off at the library on the way. I have come to enjoy the library over a period of years. I can look through gigantic atlases of the world, or use the computer to research whatever interests me. That is what I did for the remainder of the afternoon, until Eric came back after work and took me back to his place for one last dinner.

Dinner was good and we watched yet another movie before everyone retired for bed. I was nice and cozy in the house, but I was ready to be on the trail again. The insane rain storm had finally passed, and the weather was looking decent for the next day.
