I took photos and a few videos while I was on the trail. Most of the photos are not of incredible scenery. Many are simple landmarks or signs that meant something to me. As such, many of these may not be as interesting to others. Some are indeed grand vistas or interesting natural scences, but many are simple memories specific to my experience.
