title: Misinchinka High Route
---
The Misinchinka High Route is an off-trail route between Monkman Provincial Park and Azouzetta Lake in Pine LeMoray Provincial Park. Created and pioneered by Dylan Ivens, the route maintains a high elevation as much as possible. Extremely wild, there are no hiking paths, very little trace of human existence, and traversing the route is partly an exercise in survival. The only significant human infrastructure to be found on the route is the Coastal GasLink Pipeline.

# Journal

The writings from my journal were hand-written on the back of paper I used for navigation during the hike. Afterwards, I transcribed those notes here in order to provide insight into the daily grind of hiking the Misinchinka High Route.

# Commentary

A few weeks after the hike, I have put down notes, as detailed as I can make them, with more thoughts, recommendations, and any other insights which I think could be of use. This is meant to be a better description of each part of the hike, in the context of the whole trip.
