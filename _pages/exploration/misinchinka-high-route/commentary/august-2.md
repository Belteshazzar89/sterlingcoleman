## Kinney Ridge

I like the whole ridge leading up to Mount Kinney, and Mount Kinney itself. It was a beautiful area, with great views. Climbing Mount Kinney itself was interesting as well. The slope should be quite difficult, as it is loose shale rock. But there is an identifiable path up the mountain, presumably worn in by mountain goats and the odd hiker. Mount Kinney is a great place to take a break with its relatively flat top. Even I took a couple photos.

## Baby North Anzac River

The river is quite small at this spot, as my photo shows. As for the environment around the river, I found myself doing some more bushwhacking, but it wasn't nearly as bad as the area near the Coastal GasLink Pipeline the day before. Ever since that day, I was counting down the number of times I would have to descend down to 1200 meters altitude or below. Thankfully this particular part was not so bad, with the exception of the alders which I found on my way out of the valley.

## Horrible Alders

On a satellite map, the climb West from the North Anzac River looks so simple. Just hike up West towards the forested ridge line. I found out firsthand that it would not be so easy, when I ran into a huge group of thick alders right on the route. My GPS device may not have been receiving a good signal, because it appeared that there might be some way to circumvent a portion of the alders, or atleast find a streambed and climb that directly up, thereby atleast having a clear line to follow.

Instead, I ended up wasting thirty minutes or more attempting to find my way around, and instead getting horribly stuck in the worst portion of the alders, in the rain, on a steep incline. I would recommend being very wary of this area (noted on the map).

## Nice Tarns in the Rain

It's unfortunate that I was rushing to get to the end of the day, in the rain. I think in better conditions, I would have more positive things to say about this area. The climb up to the tarns South of Reynolds Ridge is nice, and the tarns themselves are nice, as is the area around them. There should be some decent camping spots in the area, even I found a spot on the terrain looking over the second tarn.
