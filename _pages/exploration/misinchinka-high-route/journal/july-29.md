I woke up feeling refreshed. Packed up a little earlier, I set off with a mission to get 20km done. I started off with a climb up to a ridge with a fantastic view of the whole region. I got to stay up there most of the morning, loving the hiking in alpine terrain, no need for rain pants to protect me from shrubs. I got a picture of the survey market above the train tunnel, far beneath the mountain.

Eventually, it came time to descend into the grassland and don the rain pants. I drank lots of water to counter the sweat. It was a hot day today. For most of the rest of the day, I was traveling West through a valley, dealing with boggy meadows, willows , and the like. It wasn't quite as bad as before, though.

Finally I descended into a rocky gulch, and made good time hopping along. Then I climbed and did the same in the opposite direction. There was a tough rock scramble, then I was on the way to a mostly dried-up pond, where I've set up camp. It is finally cooling down a bit.

The Lord has kept me safe and found me a dry spot to rest. I am so grateful.
