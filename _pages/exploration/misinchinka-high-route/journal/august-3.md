Yet another tough day. The beginning of the day was supposed to be decent, as I was at high altitude. Instead, I found the Reynolds Ridge full of rock scrambling and very dangerous descents on loose shale.

Then it was time to descend all the way down to the Misinchinka River. I was looking forward to this final low altitude portion being behind me. Thankfully, the bushwhacking was not so bad. I got some Misinchinka water and started the climb.

I had been slow all day, but eventually made it back up to the alpine elevation. I passed the tarn, hoping to cover more distance. I made the huge mistake of trying to camp at a windy pass, where the wind ripped the tent out of the ground and I lost a tent stake.

I descended into a valley and spent a sleepless night replacing rocks all along my tent edges as huge gusts ripped through at hurricane levels. I have to get out of here.
