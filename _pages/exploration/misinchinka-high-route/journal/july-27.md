It was tough to leave the Sharman house. I had rested very well. Kevin took me to see Kinuseo Falls and I got some photos. He then dropped me off at the beginning of the Imperial Creek FSR, and we said goodbye.

The roadwalk was fine, nothing remarkable. The sun came out and it was a warm day. I focused on eating my granola bars, as my pack felt very heavy. Taking a break later on to rest my feet and eat peanut butter, I soon finished the road, leaving it and closely following the defined route up the forested hillside.

Though my pack was heavy, I persevered and continued through meadows, climbing a bit as well. The route wasn't too difficult, for now at least. The amount of bushwhwacking was manageable. As I approached the final climb towards a tarn where I would camp for the night, I discovered my olive oil had spilled all over my pack! What a mess!

I had carried it all the way from Dome Creek, and now it was wasted. I cleaned up as best I could, and made the final difficult hike to the tarn. There, I cleaned up some more and set up my tent. Thankfully my trash bag liner protected my gear for the most part.

I slept well in my tent, nice and warm.
