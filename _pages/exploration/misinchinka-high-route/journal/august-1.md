I knew this day was going to be tough, but I didn't know how tough.

Coming down from the mountain arm, I was on yet another slippery descent on wet grass, and the previous night's rain didn't help. It was a long way down to Anzac stream. Willows and all kinds of bushes played their part.

The worst came later when it was time to descend to the Coastal GasLink Pipeline. This is the worst terrain I've ever seen. Very high bushes for kilometers, giant plants high above my head, thorns galore.

God got me through it all, and the climb up from the pipeline wasn't so bad. I drank lots of water and carried more. Camped out on the ridge, I ate beef jerky and peanut butter, and drank a lot of water.

I need to be careful to leave enough to get up and over Mt. Kinney.
