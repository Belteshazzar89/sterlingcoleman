Day five on the Misinchinka High Route. I passed about the halfway mark today.

Started with a big climb up to a ridge. The climbs are tough, but atleast most of the climb is in the alpine zone, out of the bushes.

Once up on the ridge, I still had more descending and climbing to do to manoeuver myself into the next valley. The big descent was tough, especially going down the narrow streambed with willows in my face. Of all the different things I have to do, descents in the bush are the worst. Tough on my ankles, easy to fall.

Going to much lower elevation meant back into the scrub. The route did a decent job of avoiding the worst of it.

I was very careful to drink lots of water today. I carried plenty while dealing with the typical side-hill bush hiking up to a mountain arm, though I did eventually enter the alpine zone.

My goal was to find a good place to camp before descending too far, and I did. I set up my tent right before a humungous thunderstorm with hail and an incredible downpour hit, and lasted four hours or more. I was so happy to be dry in my tent.
