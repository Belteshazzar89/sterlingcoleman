This was a really tough day. I think I've decided today to end my hike at Azouzetta Lake, assuming I can hike that far. In the morning I discovered I had lost a pair of socks during the oil spill cleanup. Starting late, I made very slow progress, dealing with rocks and ice.

Once down in the bush, I was charged by a young female grizzly bear with two cubs. I yelled, we circled each other for a second, then I sprayed. She ran, but the spray permeated my skin and burned for a long time.

Making my way through the Sukunka Valley took all day. Endless bushes, and not so easy to stay on route. The sun was out and it was hot. I drank plenty of water, and sweated heavily in my rain pants, necessary for the tall bushes.

I became glad to begin the hike out of the valley, and pushed on. My pack was still heavy with food and water. At one point, nearing the end, I realized that the route turned and climbed the tall rocks to my left. Taking on that challenge, I reached the top and took a short break.

My original goal had been to go much farther, but I settled for a nice spot near the tarn. At least I've been successful in staying dry and warm each night. I didn't do as many hours of hiking today, as I'm trying to take it easy on myself.
