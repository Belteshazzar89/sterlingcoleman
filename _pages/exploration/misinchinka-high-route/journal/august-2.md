Another difficult day on the MHR complete.

Actually, most of the day was not too bad. I started off up in the alpine, on my way to Mount Kinney. It was quite a climb, but I don't mind that. There is a well-defined route up the mountain, through the loose shale.

It felt great to be up so high. The descent was long and gradual at first, quite nice. Then I got back down into the bushes on the less desirable descent.

Down at lower elevation, I pushed on towards the North Anzac River. This was the hard part of the day. Getting down to the North Anzac River wasn't so bad, but getting back up, the route ran right through a big patch of alders. It started raining as I got lost trying to find my way around it. I was completely miserable, stuck in the gigantic alders, trying to fight my way uphill, trying to stay on course.

I eventually made it through and pushed on in the rain, determined to reach the tarn I had set as the goal for the day. I arrived cold and wet, and set up my tent. The end of the day had been tough, but I made it!
