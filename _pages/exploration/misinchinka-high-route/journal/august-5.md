I was pleased to wake up having slept well during the night. It was a bit cold, this high up at an iceberg tarn. I packed up and got moving, on a mission to finish the Misinchinka High Route.

I made good time in the morning, climbing and descending the waves of the ridge. It was a small psychological torture, just wanting to be done with the route, but needing to hike most of a day to finish. I found that my legs were uncharacteristically tired on climbs, needing more breaks.

A caribou came and checked me out during one my breaks. To the West, I could see the highway and the Powder King Resort. Soon, I could see Azouzetta Lake!

My final challenge was the Murray Trail. I was exhausted and made the horrible decision to attempt to cross a steep ice section, falling and sliding rapidly over a hundred meters towards my doom before self-arresting with a trekking pole.

I did get down to the bottom after that, and made it to Cafe 97. I finished!
