Once again, the Lord has come through for me. I was having trouble coming up with good motivation to hike, and I decided that I would try to make my fourth day on the MHR better than my fourth day on the GDR. But honestly, I'm not sure it was much better.

The day started with some climbs into the alpine before descending right back down near Mt. Whitford. From that point on, it was a tough go.

I had prepared myself for this, but it was still tough. I didn't put on my rain pants to protect my legs from bushes, it was just too hot. My legs got a little scratched up, but I still think I made the right choice.

When I got near the hump, the hike got ridiculous. The descent was way too steep. At one point, the route went down into a gorge, then went right up a rock wall. A fall might mean death. For the first time, I declined the route and found an alternate.

More bushes on side slopes, quite tough on my ankles, which are getting sore. I had hoped the area below Mt. Dudzic would be free of bushes, but no. I became so dehydrated I prayed for water, and got some.

I camped early, roasting in my tent until the sun went down.
