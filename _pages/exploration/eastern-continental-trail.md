On January 1st, 2012, I got off of an airplane in Key West, Florida, and started a journey from the Southernmost Point in the Continental United States North to L'Anse-aux-Meadows, at the Northernmost edge of Newfoundland, Canada. What transpired during the eight months which separated those two points was an epic journey covering sixteen American states, five Canadian provinces, and a real awakening of personal achievement.

On the way I encountered long highways, swamps, mosquitos, black flies, steep climbs, steeper descents, breathtaking views, friendly people, hilarious stories, and incredible satisfaction. Far from just a nature walk, hiking the Eastern Continental Trail showed me something about myself, something about other people, and a whole lot about the East Coast of North America.
