The Grandes Randonnées are a collection of over 300 hiking trails in France. The trails are numbered and blazed by FFRandonnées, who also has created paper guides for some of these trails. Together with my wife Alex, my daughter Miriam, and my son Daniel, we have hiked a number of these trails as a family.
