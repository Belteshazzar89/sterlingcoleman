In the morning, we woke up and I was glad that we had passed a more peaceful night, with little wind. Even better, no one had disturbed us in our tent pitched right next to the dirt road.

It was a town day, so we wanted to get moving. It was a little chilly getting out of our sleeping bags l, but we packed up and got hiking by 8:30 AM.

We didn't stop for much as we hiked past Életot and on through the fields towards Senneville-sur-Fécamp. A village with Fécamp in the name was music to our ears, and encouraged us to press on to the city where we had a bedroom reserved.

We made it through a row of windmills to the city, and descended down to the center. We had to wait for check-in time for our room, which was longer than I had hoped it would be.

Thankfully, the kids enjoyed some McDonald's while we waited, and by the afternoon we were into our room by the old Abbey.

I set off to get our town chores done. The stores in this city were smaller than I had imagined, and it was tough to find Miriam a new pair of pants and leggings to replace her worn out and holey clothing. After walking all over town, I finally settled on the meager offering at Carrefour, but atleast she wasn't dissatisfied.

We got an incredible amount of food, and I watched some Champions League soccer before bed. The next day we would head out for the famed cliffs of Étretat.
