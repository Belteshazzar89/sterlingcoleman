We woke up near Neuvillette before 8, then packed up all of our stuff, put on our wet shoes, and got hiking at 9. Pretty soon we passed the spot I had previously hoped to camp at on the road to Biville, which turned out to be a bad spot to set up a tent. Ours was much better.

There was another deviation. There have been several so far. This one brought us into the town of Penly, and from there we were walking around a nuclear power plant.

Today we were on roads almost all day. After a muddy and wet day yesterday, the roads were a welcome change.

I was once again proud of our family, showing resilience after a trying day yesterday. For myself, I have tried not to be too pushy in regards to speed and distance, but I haven't always succeeded. We average about 3 kilometers an hour, which is normal for small children, but agonizingly slow for me.

We walked through a series of villages, counting down the distance to Dieppe all day. Taking a break to cook noodles for the kids took awhile, but it was the only real break for the day. Other than that, we stopped at a beach and a nice bench looking over a town from high above.

We hobbled into Dieppe and walked the harbor and boardwalk before reaching the center of the city.

Arriving at our AirBnB, Alex and the kids stayed there while I set off to get our town chores done. It took a few hours, but I got our resupply, town food, and laundry done.

Now we're all in bed. The past two days have been tough - we did full hiking days in half of a full day on each occasion. Tomorrow should be easier, provided we take good care of our feet.
