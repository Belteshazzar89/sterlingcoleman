The first day is done. We are camped close to Neauville(?), just to the East of Biville-sur-Mer, my initial goal.

This morning, we got up and got going right on schedule. Everything went smoothly until Metro Line 4 was completely stopped so we quickly switched to another line, and made our way to Gare du Nord for our train.

Everyone else slept on the trains, and when we got to Le Tréport, we had a great ocean view, though it was misting and foggy. We got out of town after we checked out the Funicular.

There was a little complaining in the early portion of the hike, but we made it through and got to Criel-sur-Mer, where we got a baguette and croissants. We walked and ate the whole day, only stopping for a real break once or twice in Criel-sur-Mer. Leaving there, we climbed up out of town and then hit a horrendously muddy section.

With our shoes covered in mud, we then hit some wet grass that soaked our shoes and socks. We persevered and made it as far as we possibly could, about 18 km.

I'm so proud of our family, everyone was hurting but we took on the challenge and hiked a full day despite an afternoon start at Le Tréport.

We've cooked and got into our sleeping bags now. Hoping that we are all prepared for a big day to get into Dieppe tomorrow. Not looking forward to our wet shoes.
