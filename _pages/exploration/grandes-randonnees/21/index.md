The GR21 is a trail which offers magnificent views of the cliffs of Normandy on the Côte d'Albâtre. Stretching from Le Tréport to Le Havre, the 200 kilometers offered by the GR21 show off the English Channel, the agricultural setting of the Seine-Maritime department, and many little villages with lovely homes.

Our family arrived at the Eastern terminus at the Le Tréport train station on April 11, 2024. We hiked for 11 straight days, finishing at Le Havre's train station on April 21. This was the first hiking trip of consequence for my wife and children, and it was a huge success! For my son Daniel, 6, and my daughter Miriam, 8, it was their first experience hiking and camping in the tent for multiple days.

I'll always cherish my memories of those days on the GR21.
