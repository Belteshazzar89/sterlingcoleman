We had agreed to get going early in order to get to the store in Aydat before it closed at noon. To do that, we had to cover some ground.

We quickly arrived in La Caissiere, and followed the trail around it and on towards our food. The morning walk was mostly on dirt roads between farm fields.

Our friends were smart to put their rain covers on their backpacks, as we got a little sprinkle in the morning, though it subsided quickly. I wore both my sweatshirt and raincoat together and was warm and dry.

We walked quickly, perhaps pushed by the thought of food, and arrived at the point closest to Aydat around 10:30. Some of us stayed put to wait, and some started down the hill to the convenience store at Aydat.

I didn't see Alex, and she started down without any money. I grabbed the money and jogged down the hill, arriving at the store well before the others, who took a detour. Reunited at the store, we bought our food and climbed back up out of town.

A dense fog had set in, and we enjoyed our lunch in the middle of it. Our hike onwards was under gray skies, and soon enough a very light rain started up.

I hate hiking in the rain, but this was a very light rain, and we had good company. I was impressed by the good attitude of our whole group, hiking on continuously in less-than-ideal conditions.

We went through the aptly-named Saulzat-le-Froid, got some water, and hiked on along farm roads covered in mud and cow droppings.

Our goal was the Lac de Servi√®res, where Alex was hoping to wash her feet. We went through Pessade, and when we found a brook with some flat ground nearby we stopped early and camped there.

Everyone was happy. The children played, Alex and I washed up, and we enjoyed the cover of the trees. The background noise of the brook was good for sleeping.
