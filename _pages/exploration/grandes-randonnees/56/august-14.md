The previous day, we got up at 4AM and traveled all day just to get to Méolans-Revel. The bus dropped us off at La Fresquière, and we walked around and found an acceptable spot in the woods to set up our tent.

We woke up and packed up our stuff. I didn't rush us, as we weren't on a strict schedule and I figured we had plenty of time. We made our way back to the trail and started the GR56 in earnest.

Our packs were very heavy with lots of food. I set about getting everyone to drink water regularly from their bottles. I kept my bottles full and transferred water to Alex and the kids throughout the day.

Soon we were through the little village at Meolans, and we kept on climbing up, up, up. It was a daunting task, but we were doing it, one slow step at a time. We passed by a few little farmhouses, and kept climbing. Taking frequent breaks to rest, we slowly made our way past the last reaches of human habitation, and still kept climbing.

After many breaks and hours passed, we stopped for lunch at Riou Brounin, at 2000 meters altitude. That marked over 900 meters altitude gain from our starting point.

We finally got going again and eventually arrived at Séolane Pass. It was quite windy and we didn't take a long break. From there, it was endless switchbacks as we descended down the other side to Laverq Abbey.

We were almost as slow going down as we were going up. The trail often was on the edge of a drop, and Alex was very worried about Daniel, who had slipped a few times. She held onto him and together they brought up the rear.

By the time we made it down to Laverq Abbey, it was after 4PM. I was getting a little agitated at our slow progress. We were atleast heartened by the relatively flat trail ahead.

It must be said that the Abbey stuck out as a refuge for hikers in a relative wilderness. We saw only one hiker at Meolans, and then nobody until we arrived in the vicinity of Laverq Abbey. As we left the abbey, we also left behind the people and were pretty much alone again.

We walked the gravel road that made up the trail, and made it to some picnic tables by the river for dinner. I went ahead and explored ahead to find the Cabane du Plan Bas while the others stayed to rest and cook.

I discovered no one there, and a good spot to sleep. Back with the others, we cooked and washed ourselves as a thunderstorm rolled in. I rushed Daniel up to the cabin, and Miriam and Alex were not far behind.

We made it to a nice dry cabin, and enjoyed the extra space. Lighting a candle, Alex did some more work with our packs as I got the sleeping bags out and hopped in mine. It had been a long, slow day, but we had made it.
