The GR56 is a loop trail, also called the Tour de l'Ubaye. This trail of a little more than  150 kilometers performs a complete circuit of the Ubaye, covering high mountain passes and a few small communities.

We got off the bus at La Fresquière in Méolans-Revel, slept nearby, then started off on our journey the next morning. Over the following 7+ days, we endured high winds and rain, many cliffs, the trail going right up a waterfall, and the heat of August on many tough climbs. Throught it all, we experienced the beauty of the Ubaye in all its glory. We traveled relatively untouched high mountain areas, saw wildlife we have never seen before, cooled our feet in pristine mountain streams, and visited the quaint mountain villages and hamlets in the Ubaye valley.

The difficulty of the trail was matched by its beauty, and though I had no idea what awaited us before we embarked on this adventure, I'm glad that we accepted the challenge as a family and completed the GR56 together.
