We woke up in the gray light of a cloudy day once again. It wasn't really raining, so we got to packing up. Sadly, we got hit by rain right as we were getting the tent taken down and packed up.

In the morning, we dealt with some light rain as we walked an old abandoned road in the forest. It must be mentioned that the fall colors are beautiful here, and the storms have been whipping the leaves off of the trees.

The rain continued, and we decided after following a road for a short distance to dive into the woods and set up the tent for a break. We had watched a storm brewing across the valley from our vantage point, and didn't want to get hit by it.

Alex cooked us up some noodles and ham, and we ate happily. I could feel that my heart had resumed its erratic rhythm, and I tried to stay warm in my sleeping bag.

Eventually it was time to leave. We packed up and got going. It seemed that it wasn't raining when we left, but soon the rains came again, and a fierce wind picked up.

I wasn't feeling very good, but after an earnest prayer, the rain soon stopped and the sun  shine down on us for the rest of the day.

It was such a blessing to be walking in warm sunshine for a change. We made our way to Garde Guérin, a medieval walled city. The kids played, but we left quickly because we couldn't find the food we needed.

We raced off to Villefort, and made record time. Miriam and Daniel were in high spirits, which was great. We saw the big Villefort Lake and I got scared as we walked across the bridge on the dam, high above the water.

In Villefort we got everything we needed. Bread and cookies from the bakery, and more groceries. It felt nice to take advantage of the convenience of modern civilization.

We hiked out of town and decided to camp right on the path before a climb. It was late and darkness was approaching soon. It was a highly successful day, and we all felt good.
