We woke up early and prepared to leave. All day we were taking various trains and a bus to get to the much vaunted Puy-en-Velay.

It took two trains and a packed bus, but we made it. I enjoyed the classic medieval alleyways we took on our approach to the starting point. No big signs awaited us, so we took a few photos at the fountain and we're on our way.

It has been a long day of travel, so I was just hoping we could muster the energy to hike out of town and camp. With a 7:45 PM start time, it was dark before we started.

There is a sort of carnival in town, with rides and lights and music. We passed by it as we gradually hiked uphill to the beginning of the darkness.

Pushing on, we found the energy to make it up a grassy hill and have set up our tent in a spot partially protected from the wind.

I'm proud of our group for doing a little night hiking and having a good attitude to searching for a spot to camp. I'm sure everyone just wants to go to sleep.
