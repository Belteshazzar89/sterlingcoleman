When we woke up, the light was still dim, but not because the sun was not up yet, but rather because it was behind a thick layer of gray clouds. It would remain there throughout the day.

We packed up as best we could and got moving. We had most of our rain gear on, though it wasn't raining yet. It made sense to be prepared, plus we had been blasted by the wind the day before.

Landos was very close, and soon we were on the way to La Sauvetat. Once there, the rain arrived and we got the rest of our rain gear on.

It was a bit tough to be hiking in the rain once again. I had the foolish hope that perhaps we had left the rain behind since the previous afternoon had been clear. The kids did well, and I warmed up their hands, made cold by the rain.

The rain was light, and sometimes it stopped completely for a few minutes. The hike from La Sauvetat to Pradelles was nothing but farm fields. I found it a bit monotonous.

Before we got to Pradelles, we spotted a spot where we could set up our tent beneath some trees. We took that opportunity to have lunch and take a short nap. This turned out to be a great decision.

At 2 in the afternoon, we packed up and got going. I felt great after the morale boost of being out of the rain for awhile. It wasn't raining as we got into Pradelles.

I don't think Alex was impressed with the town. I believe she mentioned to me that the whole place was falling apart. In any case, every store was closed on a Tuesday afternoon, which felt a bit odd. There was a nice church there though.

Thankfully we had already determined to continue on to the city of Langogne, not too far beyond. We were energized and walked straight there without a break.

In Langogne we took a short detour to get food at the big supermarket, then made our way out of town. This was the biggest city we had seen after leaving Le Puy-en-Velay.

The rain started back up as we searched for a spot to camp. I had marked a possible spot on my map, but it was a walk to get there. We found a decent spot in the woods and set up our tent before the rain picked up in the evening.

Everyone is in good spirits despite the weather, and I think we've covered decent ground.
