Another early morning for the Coleman family. We had taken our time arriving in Alès, not wanting to force ourselves to push too hard. Now the time had come to walk longer distances until the end of the trail. Otherwise, we risk missing our train or not finishing the trail.

Leaving the apartment as the sun made its appearance, we returned to the trail and began the long process of walking out of the city.

Truth be told, though we had enjoyed our stay in the apartment, the city of Alès didn't leave a great impression on us. Besides the persistent presence of trash, we just didn't notice anything particularly great about it. Perhaps we've just been spoiled with all the picturesque medieval villages we've traversed on this pilgrimage.

Finally past the last remnants of Alès, we began hopping from village to village, with never more than a couple hours in between. We were on a roll, covering a good distance before lunch on the path between two villages.

Vézénobres, Ners, and Cruviers-Lascours were left behind as we surged forward, détermined to put ourselves in the best position we could for the days to come. We didn't come across an open store in any of these places, and Alex got a bottle of water from a nice couple in Brignon.

Finally in Moussac we got to the store and bought all kinds of food. Happy, we left town with sore feet, ready to find a place to camp.

The sun was not quite ready to set as we picked a spot in the corner of a farmer's field. It was a bit too conspicuous for my taste, even with a few trees for cover. Unfortunately, it was the best option.

Alex got to cooking up dinner for the children as I continued my journaling and
planning. We had hiked the longest distance ever as a family.
