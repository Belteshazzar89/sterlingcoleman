We all woke up super early, apparently very ready to get into the city and get some deserved showers. I asked Alex why the time on my watch didn't match our phones, and she explained that the hour had changed overnight. No wonder we were up so early.

The tent was packed up in record time and we were on the move. It was quickly apparent that we had made the right choice in camping at that spot, as there was nothing else that looked good for a tent as we progressed down the mountain.

Soon we were in Saint-Martin-de-Valgalgues, where I stood in a long line at the bakery to get some breakfast for everyone.

Continuing on, as we entered the outskirts of Alès, we saw a Go Kart race start, and took some pictures. We stayed to watch the whole race, which was surprisingly entertaining.

Marching on with the energy that only a day in town can provide, we made our way into the city and detoured to a large grocery store to get lots of food before the store (and most other stores in the city) closed at noon.

Laden down with food but happy to have what we needed, we returned to the trail and walked into the city center, where we took another detour and headed for our AirBnB apartment.

Taking a break at McDonald's for the children's lunch, I received the all-important access code and we got into the apartment early.

It was such a relief to have our own private space, if just for the night. We had been on the road for a full week. I set out with almost every article of clothing we had brought with us, and got them washed at a laundromat.

Back at the apartment, we ate until we were full, and ate some more. The children got to sleep and we did as well, in beds for a night.
