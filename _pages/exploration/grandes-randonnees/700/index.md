The "Regordane" is a medieval path tracing from North to South, starting in Le Puy-en-Velay and reaching 245 kilometers to the South to the village of Saint-Gilles, not far from the Mediterranean.

Our family went out for a hike together for the first time in a year. The weather was poor from the start, but I was impressed by the tenacity of our group to push through and hike every day.

We pushed our limits in several ways. Miriam had a new, bigger backpack, and she was carrying more weight. We were all carrying more clothing, with plenty of rain gear. Our schedule called for us to hike well over 20 kilometers a day on average, and we actually did over 30 kilometers together for the first time.

I think this was more difficult a hike to do than even our "Tour de l'Ubaye" on the GR56 in the Alps, just because of too much rain and the longer distance. I'm proud of us for finishing the GR700.
