Last day of the hike! We got up early as usual and got out of Générac, hitting the roads. The path has been all roads from Nîmes onward, and we continued on paved and dirt roads this morning.

We made good time, very ready to finish our Regordane adventure. It was still some distance to Saint-Gilles, however, and we knew that. The fields have been mostly grape vines for some time, and we got to see more of those here. This was definitely South France.

I wore my rain gear just to be sure to avoid the effects of the cool morning air, though it did rain. It felt appropriate to finish this hike the way we started it, wearing our rain gear.

We didn't take many breaks. I was asked many times how many more kilometers until the end, everyone hoping to see Saint-Gilles around the next bend of the road.

Soon enough we entered the outskirts of the village, passing a couple of farms, as well as a couple of hikers. This was rare, we have seen almost no one hiking with backpacking gear on this trail.

Entering Saint-Gilles, we got something to drink at the store, then made our way to the Abbey of Saint-Gilles. Finished!

Taking some photos, we relaxed on the steps of the abbey, appreciating our accomplishment. The village buzzed around us as we sat for awhile, celebrating by not hiking.

When it was time to go, we went back to the bus stop and made our way back to Nîmes, and finally our home in Île-de-France. It had been a relatively tough challenge ge for us, which we were proud to overcome together.
