My heart went back to its normal rhythm in the night. We slept in in the morning, not needing to hike a long distance today.

First thing we did was hike up a hill and make our way to the village of Saint-André-Capcèze. It was a nice little hike in the woods.

We did quite a lot of walking on pavement today. I was wondering if the comments we saw about the amount of pavement would come true, as up until now we had not had too much. Today was mostly pavement.

We had a nice break for lunch after leaving Vielvic, up on top of a hill. We were a little concerned about rain, so we set up the tent, though we mostly just stashed our packs inside.
After lunch we made it to Concoules, where the kids found a playground and I found a bathroom. We were all quite pleased.

More pavement led us out of town, and we stayed on pavement for the rest of the way into Genolhac, with little exception.

We liked the town of Genolhac. There is a lot of old charm and history. At the grocery store, Alex and the children got what we needed, and we left town.

Unsurprisingly, we walked paved roads for a few kilometers out of town. When it came time to change onto a footpath, we looked for a place to camp.

It was very difficult to find a decent spot. The whole area was steep slopes, rocks, and the occasional trash. We took the only plausible spot, and wedged the tent in among tree roots.

I walked a ways to get us more water from a nearby river, and confirmed that there were no better tent sites around. At least we are camped in a spot where we can be certain to not be disturbed.
