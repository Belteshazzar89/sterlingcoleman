It was not a bad night on the hill up above Le Puy-en-Velay. I don't normally sleep too well in a full tent, but I was warm and got some good rest.

In the morning, it was sprinkling as we broke camp. It's never fun to pack up a tent in the rain, but we did it and got moving. I was pleased that I had got rain gear for everyone, though unhappy that Alex couldn't find her rain pants.

We put on brave faces and set out in the rain. I might be the most disturbed by the rain, moreso than Alex or the children. The rain continued for the rest of the morning, but we walked through it. We took breaks whenever we found a covered bus stop bench.

I was under the impression that we would be on paved roads for most of the way, but was pleasantly surprised to find that we were out in the forest for a short stint, and we had plenty of dirt roads as well.

The hike was nothing too remarkable for most of the day, although we appreciated the footbridge high up over the valley below.

There were plenty of farms along the way, and the children made it clear they didn't enjoy the aroma that comes with the farm. Many cows glared at us as we passed by.

We were so grateful that the rain stopped before noon. Even with rain gear, we had gotten a bit damp, and were pleased to dry out quickly as the sun shone down on us.

We made it into Costaros, and got a little extra food. We set out from there, knowing that we needed to camp soon as everyone's feet were sore, especially Daniel's.

It was difficult to find a good spot to camp among the farms. The area between Costaros and Landos is mostly a valley full of farm fields.

Almost arriving at Landos, we came across a stand of trees and dove in. It is almost certainly private property, but we plan to get up early and leave before anyone notices us.
