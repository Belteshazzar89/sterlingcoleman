It wasn't my favorite night on the trail. I should have placed our tent farther from the corner of the two paved roads, but I thought it was important to be nestled in among the trees. There were joggers and cyclists coming by right before sunset and a car honked at us twice. I really hate being camped in a publicly visible spot, it feels like a vulnerable spot, prey to all the disturbed and rude people who might happen upon us.

We were up early and hiking. On the paved road into Saint-Chaptes, we were moving along quickly. Our mission was to get to the big grocery stores at La Calmette. I knew that we wouldn't get there before early afternoon, but it was good motivation for us.

The villages along the way made for good milestones. Aubarne and Russan fell into our rearview mirror before lunch. We then passed by Dions and continued straight on to La Calmette.

It was hot outside for a change, and Miriam was sweating. I told her that our clothing was made for all the cloudy and rainy days we had experienced in the past few days, and we would have to suffer today since we couldn't prepare for every eventuality.

At Lidl, we got plenty of groceries and I got myself some ice cream. Leaving there, Alex's feet were hurting, and mine were too. My shoes were rubbing against the tops of all my toes.

Our mission for the afternoon was to get as close to the big city of Nîmes while still finding a private spot to set up our tent. Thankfully, we were treated to a beautiful mountain area with many trails.

People from the city were out running, hiking, and enjoying the sunshine. We continued South and camped behind one of the big water tanks presumably placed for combating forest fires. We weren't far from Nîmes, and I felt we had a great day.

Our mission to finish the Regordane by Thursday was still on track.
