Allow me to introduce myself. I'm a Follower, Husband, Father, Engineer, and Adventurer, in that order.

I was raised to follow Jesus, and as I continue to think about what that really means, I've stuck to that principle.

Married for a number of years to a lovely woman who continues to support me in my ambitions and follows me in my plans, It has taken time for me to comfortably settle into my marriage. Now I've found many new things to be thankful for that I hadn't imagined when I embarked on this path.

My children continue to make me bite my tongue as I try not to laugh while scolding them. No, you cannot jump into my arms from the top of the staircase. No, it's not your birthday yet, your birthday was last month. Yes, I do still love you even though you continue to interrupt me when I am trying to work.

The spirit with which I have set upon these roles is at its core one of adventure. I love a physical adventure. I also love an emotional challenge. Being a husband and father has certainly increased my capacities in that regard. These days, I'm finding that even my faith is not merely a set choice, but rather a subject which I must either advance or leave to be eroded.
