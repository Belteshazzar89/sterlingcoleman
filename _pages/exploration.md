I've always been appreciative of the less-traveled path. Being in the minority or even alone never bothered me. When I first discovered hiking I was in love. Since then I've dreamt big and hope to explore the earth in many ways.

Until now, my most interesting adventure has been the Eastern Continental Trail.
