It’s the day when we watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_the_Great_Pumpkin,_Charlie_Brown&quot;&gt;It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&lt;/a&gt;, we set out our jack o’ lanterns for the last night, and our daughter wears her costume all day in high anticipation of trick-or-treating that night. Except that with the global events of this year, especially this month, Halloween is pretty much cancelled in France as far as I can tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday night, President Macron announced that the nation would be under a new lockdown order until at least December 1 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. France had seen the number of new cases of the disease approach the 50,000 mark, with the total number of total active cases soaring up to and above 1 million. While the number of deaths from the disease is still relatively low, currently just under 300 for the 7-day moving average, that number would continue to increase if no measures were taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue in France in recent weeks has been the rising conflict between radical Islamists and the French state, which has not backed down from its support of the guarantee of the freedom of expression, including displaying on its own initiative a caricature of Mohammed, the central figure to the Muslim religion, which has caused an outcry among the more violently-inclined elements of the Islamic world. Macron’s statement that Islam is a religion “in crisis globally” did nothing to please other Muslims, both in France and abroad. This is hardly a new subject, and surely will not be cleanly resolved by the end of the year, but the fact that the issue seems to be flaring up worse than before is in keeping with the way that 2020 has been going, and as things will be going for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, the new quarantine doesn’t bother me all that much. We’ve already been subjected to a long quarantine at the beginning of the year, during which I worked from home, Miriam did not go to school, and we needed to fill out a form every time we left the house. This time, Miriam will still be in school, and I will most likely still be going into the office, though I may end up working from home for a portion of the week. The important difference is that schools will remain open, which will make this new quarantine, however long it lasts, much easier to bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s during times like these that life in France seems pretty good. In this situation, the centralized government of France has the authority and the willingness to make the tough decisions necessary to allow people’s lives to continue on with as little disruption as possible. I feel for those in the USA or elsewhere whose children have been at home since March, or who have either lost their jobs or don’t know when they will receive another full paycheck. Generally speaking, in a crisis, central leadership has a better chance of producing a favorable result than a system in which fifty individual states decide their policies, or when each of thousands of school system governments determine how they will respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our family has handled the events of 2020 surprisingly well. To start things off, our trip to Wuhan, China was of course cancelled. My long-suffering wife took care of two children mostly by herself for a few months while many French families pawned their children off on the grandparents full-time. COVID-19 might be the best thing that ever happened to Daniel, who enjoys having more people at the house to play with each day. Though I was initially disappointed to lose my position at a small company that could no longer pay my salary, I immedialy found another position as a CTO / Lead Developer of another small company. My commute has been reduced by about half an hour. Miriam has taken the dissapointment of not trick-or-treating in stride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it certainly is a shame that we can’t do much for Halloween this year besides a couple of jack o’ lanterns, we count ourselves lucky that our lifestyle has not been substantially disrupted. In the future, we’ll be doing everything we can to ensure that things stay that way. COVID-19 may eventually cease to be a real concern, but based on the global trends we are seeing now, a year or two or from now, for some of us missing out on Halloween might be the least of our problems.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">Today is Halloween.

I do this reading on my commute, as I take the train into work. I’m lucky to take a train with enough seating for everyone, which is not at all the case for some people on their commute. I find that, depending on the size of the book, I can usually read about one page every two minutes. Most books are divided into small chapters of fifteen to twenty pages, or have larger chapters divided into parts of fifteen to twenty pages, which is perfect for my thirty-five minute train ride. Reading on the commute is a good use of my time, as otherwise I would just be scrolling my phone, which ultimately doesn’t lead to anything productive. It is definitely one of the perks of using public transportation instead of driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My arbitrarily-set goal of one book per month does not always work out perfectly, as in this year when I got a late start due to having not yet finished last year’s books, and then started my 2020 list with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/272793.Imperial_China_900_1800&quot;&gt;Imperial China 900-1800&lt;/a&gt;, which is a great book, but extremely long. I didn’t finish it until May, meaning I was already 4 books behind schedule. By now I’m starting to catch up, but I still have to double my normal pace to finish the list by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I structure my list in a specific way to cover the subjects that interest me the most. There are two basic types of books on my list: culture or history books, and adventure books. Everything is non-fiction. I’m interested in learning reading about the culture and history of the USA, Mexico, France, Egypt, Russia, and China. As there is a lot of material out there on American history, I include two American history books in my yearly list. I read one book on each of the other countries, and I also add a book on geopolitics or anthropology. For example, in 2019 I read Jared Diamond’s well-known &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1842.Guns_Germs_and_Steel&quot;&gt;Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies&lt;/a&gt;, and this year I am reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/475.Collapse&quot;&gt;Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed&lt;/a&gt; by the same author. For the remaining third of my list, I read books on true tales of adventure or nature which interest me. For example, hiking, sailing, source-to-sea descents of rivers, or tales of survival. This year I’m trying something a little different by reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276431-on-trails&quot;&gt;On Trails: An Exploration&lt;/a&gt;, in which I am honored to be briefly mentioned by the author, Robert Moor, because of my time on the International Appalachian Trail, as part of my Eastern Continental Trail thru-hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, the adventure books are much shorter, and so I finish them quickly, which is good since I typically take over a month to read some of the longer historical books. The biggest book I’ve read is probably the mammoth &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1111.The_Power_Broker&quot;&gt;The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York&lt;/a&gt;, which I believe took me about ten weeks, which is not bad for twelve hundred pages. It’s inevitable that I will occasionally pick a book that is not what I thought it would be. I’ve found that there is not very much material on modern Egyptian history and culture, and that therefore I’ve picked out books that turned out to be much more academic than I am used to. I might be hard-pressed to give a good account of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/167462.Colonising_Egypt&quot;&gt;Colonising Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, and this year I am going to read the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/263757.Cairo_Cosmopolitan&quot;&gt;Cairo Cosmopolitan&lt;/a&gt; book, which I hope will be more accessible despite it’s academic appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far this year, I have nothing but good things to say about the books that I have picked out. That isn’t surprising, since I try to only pick books that are well-known, and have at least a four-star average rating on Goodreads. When finding books on Egypt, Russia, or Mexico, I sometimes have to disregard that standard. I also have to consider that some adventure books are more interesting to me than the average person, such as Colin Angus’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/641473.Lost_in_Mongolia&quot;&gt;Lost in Mongolia: Rafting the World’s Last Unchallenged River&lt;/a&gt;. However, in general I’ve had very little dissapointment by sticking to Goodreads ratings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m proud of myself for picking up reading, as for a long period of time I did no real reading at all. From the time I entered college until very recently, I didn’t really see the appeal of investing time into reading a large book. I don’t usually like the feeling of starting something and then feeling obligated to finish it. But I have to say that reading has been a good way to engage in critical thinking, not just about history, culture, or adventure, but about the allegories between what I am reading and the basics of life. Perhaps the only downside to reading large books is that it is simply not possible for me to remember details of these books. If asked, I could give a decent summary, and talk about the main points, but things like names and dates often are lost over time. Despite that, it’s very satisfying to look over the bookshelf and see all the good I’ve read.

The migration involves moving many tables, and several Gigabytes of data, which must all be moved without any loss. With a move like this, there is a lot to do besides just transferring the data from one base to another, such as refactoring all the raw queries in the backend of the application which must now use SQL syntax compatible with PostgreSQL, changing model definitions in the backend to use PostgreSQL data types, and finding any inconsistencies in the ORM (Object-relational mapping). With all of this and more to do, it is important to find a simple and fast solution for migrating the actual data from one database to another. This is where &lt;a href=&quot;https://pgloader.readthedocs.io/&quot;&gt;pgloader&lt;/a&gt; comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pgloader is an open source tool, created by Dimitri Fontaine, author of “Mastering PostgreSQL in Application Development”. The tool has the ability to do migrations to and from PostgreSQL and MySQL, MSSQL, SQLite, and even Citrus databases. It can also transfer data from one PostgreSQL database to another. The tool can load data from files in CSV, DBF, and IBX format. pgloader is quite versatile, and in my opinion is the best option for any type of PostgreSQL data transfer. There are other tools out there, but most are not free, and none of the other options that I saw looked as well-developed as pgloader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ease of the learning curve for the tool is probably the reason that it has become popular. By simply installing the tool from the command line, and copying and modiying an example of a configuration file from pgloader’s documentation, we can start migrating data. This file connects to both the source and target database, and migrates the data. The file is also full of customizable choices, such as whether to drop and recreate the tables, create the schema, deal with foreign keys, index, and sequences, and most importantly, cast certain data types in a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, great applications are made by great default values and choices which streamline the user’s most common navigation path. These defaults must also be easily overriden and customized to capture the portion of the user base which has a specific use case scenario. pgloader does that well. It has default casting rules for each type of database, meaning that for most users performing a migration to PostgreSQL, the tool will take care of all data type definition and conversion. In the case that specific casting rules are needed, it is easy to put those rules in the load file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pgloader is also very fast. The tool could probably migrate two or three times the amount of data that pg_restore (the native PostgreSQL command for filling a database) could upload in the same amount of time. This is because the tool is written in Common Lisp, which can be compiled to machine code and use parallel computing and threads. Related to this is perhaps the only real drawback to pgloader that I found. Because of the Common Lisp compilation needs, it is difficult to get the dependencies for pgloader to all play together nicely on a Windows environment. Most notably, Make and Steel Bank Common Lisp will have difficulty compiling. Common solutions are to use Windows Subsystem for Linux, or Docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, it is a good thing that pgloader was able to painlessly migrate the desired data from MySQL to PostgreSQL, because all the other parts of this type of migration turned out to be anything but painless. All functions for dates had to be translated from one syntax of SQL to the other. Simply concatenating strings is different, as is returning the first non-null value among several choices. References to tables names and aliases must be made differently, as are several other things. Even the ORM used for the project had different behavior in a couple of special cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most professional projects, I would recommend moving away from MySQL. Though it is an easy database to get started with, and has great supporting tools, complex projects suffer from issues with data types, and unforeseen background issues. For example, I recently ran into a problem when I loaded a backup of a database and found that the timestamp values I loaded were different from the source because of a timezone difference in my local system. This would normally be fine if timestamps were compared to other typestamps, but when the timestamp is compared to a datetime, all havoc occurs as data is misplaced and statistics are marred when one of the values is a few hours off. Instead of having to deal with that, I would recommend moving to PostgreSQL if another SQL flavor is required. PostgreSQL has useful data types such as json, which can be used to enhance performance if modeled correctly. When you make the move, I recommend pgloader as your guide.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">As part of a recent project, I’ve been dealing with a difficult database migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL.

I don’t normally pay too much attention to hockey, but I enjoy sports, and this particular year, the Dallas Stars made a big run. They were favored to beat the Calgary Flames, and they did that, finishing them off in 6 games, though they lost the first game, and were still down a game after the first three games in the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second round, the Stars were up against the #2 Coloroado Avalanche, who had only lost a single game in the previous round to the Arizona Coyotes. Dallas came out strong, winnnig the first two games, but then lapsed and lost the fourth and fifth games. In Game 7, Joel Kiviranta, a relatively unknown player, scored a hat trick, and his overtime goal won the series for the Stars, sending them to the Western Conference Finals against the top-ranked Vegas Golden Knights. The stars played stronger than ever, and for the second series in a row, upset their opponents, this time only requiring five games to record the necessary four wins to advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Stanley Cup Finals, the Dallas Stars faced the formidable Tampa Bay Lightning, who had pummeled their previous three opponents, never facing a Game 7, and only once requiring a sixth game. The Stars came out strong with a Game 1 win, but then lost the next three. They were able to scramble for a Game 5 win in double overtime, but couldn’t stop the Lightning, who won the Stanley Cup in Game 6. The Stars had a great run, and normally my interest in hockey would end there for the time being, except for the fact that in the meantime I had come across Steve Dangle’s YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve “Dangle” Glynn works for Sportsnet, a Canadian entertainment company. For a few years he has put out hockey content at a pretty regular pace. He has a couple of regulary-occurring segments, such as Steve’s Dang-its and Hat Picks. The Dang-its are great, because they are basic blooper compilations taken from anything happening in the NHL during the week. Since I’m not a hockey player, I wouldn’t necessarily know what hockey players consider to be a major blunder. Some are obvious, but others are things I wouldn’t pick unless they were pointed out to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting series is Steve’s Trade Trees. He definitely has plenty of help in constructing these videos, as they are explanations of the ramifications, often complicated, of trading hockey players. Steve compares the number of games that teams are able to get out of players, the number of points (goals and assists) that players produce, salary cap space, and of course the outcome of draft picks. Things get complicated when teams make a trade, then trade the resulting pieces of the initialy trade, and then trade again. Things get especially complicated when deals are done with multiple players changing teams at a time, meaning that we can’t really quantify the exact importance of an individual player in the trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interest for me is that Steve actually makes these videos interesting. I’m a big enough sports fan that I have already gone and seen the NHL fight compilation videos, the videos showing big hits, the incredible goals. For most sports that I’ve never actually played, that would be the extend of my interest. I’m not going to watch an entire hockey game, and I’m not going to know the individual players, beyond the stars. But Steven is very entertaining in his presentation of the material. He has energy and I can tell he has empathy for the players and feels bad for them when they mess up, and exasperated with his own team, the Toronto Maple Leafs, when they let him down. On that note, possibly his most entertaining video is his recap of Toronto’s loss to the Carolina Hurricanes, in which both of Carolina’s goaltenders were injured, and they were forced to put the emergency goalkeeper, an amateur employed by Toronto, who normally drives the Zamboni to resurface the ice. In videos such as these, Steve is quite entertaining in his demonstrativeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entertainment factor makes the normally routine blunder videos a must-watch for me, and makes the long Trade Tree videos understandable and interesting. Steve succeeds in entertaining while also making the subject more interesting for casual fans, and making it easier to understand the more arcane aspects of managing these teams and the players. That’s the difference between me just watching a few compilation videos and moving on, and me coming back periodically to see the latest content. I’m still not going to watch full games, but Steve has managed to pique my interest in more than just big hits, and that’s an accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">At the end of this summer, the National Hockey League (NHL) returned from its interruption due to COVID-19, and started a modified version of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. I don’t normally pay too much attention to hockey, but I enjoy sports, and this particular year, the Dallas Stars made a big run. They were favored to beat the Calgary Flames, and they did that, finishing them off in 6 games, though they lost the first game, and were still down a game after the first three games in the series.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Versailles in the National 2</title><link href="/blog/2020/10/versailles-fc-national-2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Versailles in the National 2" /><published>2020-10-03T12:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-10-03T12:00:00+02:00</updated><id>/blog/2020/10/versailles-fc-national-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2020/10/versailles-fc-national-2.html">&lt;p&gt;Though I always am happy when Paris Saint-Germain is doing well, they are a team which is expected to win everything in France, and to compete for European titles. They did that recently, making it all the way to the UEFA Champions League Final. Nevertheless, I don’t find it very exciting to wait the entire season for a few competitive matches in the European competitions. Luckily, lower-level teams closer to me have been performing well. Specifically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fcversailles78.com/&quot;&gt;FC Versailles&lt;/a&gt; have moved up a level to the National 2 this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the department called “Yvelines” where we live, Versailles is by far the most populated town, literally the department’s crown jewel. It is easily the biggest tourist destination in the department, and the entry point for further travel from Paris to the rest of the department, with the notable exception of the towns to the Northwest along the Seine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the other teams in the department FC Versailles and AS Poissy stand as the top teams, both competing in the National 2, the fourth tier of the French Football Pyramid. The previous year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aspoissyfoot.com/&quot;&gt;AS Poissy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://fcmantois.com/&quot;&gt;FC Mantois&lt;/a&gt; were competing in the National 2, and Versailles was in the National 3, one level down. FC Mantois had a terrible seaon, claiming just 5 points in 21 matches, definitely relegated to the National 3. AS Poissy managed to get 22 points in as many games, being the last team not to be relegated. Meanwhile, FC Versailles had a fantastic season in the National 3, barely beating out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usivryfootball.com/&quot;&gt;US Ivry&lt;/a&gt; to win first place, the only team to be promoted to the National 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidently, in a pyramid structure, it is much easier to be relegated than promoted. The National 3 consists of 12 groups of 14 teams each, for a total of 168 teams. One team from each group is promoted. Due to administrative decisions, the number of teams relegated can change, but normally, 36 teams are sent down to the regional leagues. The same ratio exists in the Naional 2, where of the 64 teams, 4 are promoted, and 12 are relegated. Though the ratio between relegated and promoted teams is the same, the chance that a team is relegated or promoted is not exactly the same, because the National 2 has groups of 16 teams, whereas the National 3 has groups of 14 teams. In comparison, promotion is harder to achieve in the National 2, and relegation easier to avoid. However, the pyramid structure becomes linear at the level above the National 2, the Championnat National. Of the 18 teams at that level, 2.5 teams (there is a playoff between the third-placed team and the corresponding team from Ligue 2, the level above the National) are promoted and 4 relegated. This doubles the chance of promotion compared to that in the National 2, and only slightly increases the chance of relegation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Versailles could make it to the National, that would be huge. But doing so would be a big step up from where the team is now. After 7 games played, the team has just 7 points, putting them on the brink of relegation back to the National 3. Thankfully, there are still 23 matches to be played, so there is plenty of time for the team to pick up enough points. Generally speaking, a team needs to 60 points (2 per match) to be promoted. 30 points (1 per match) is the edge of relegation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend, Versailles will enter into the Coupe de France, nation’s largest football tournament, pitting over 8,000 teams against each other in a series of single elimination matches, in which higher ranked teams enter as each round passes. The tournament is interesting, but mostly a matter of honor for teams in the National 2 or 3, which must win several successive matches just to enter the seventh round, where the rewards start at a few thousand euros. Last year, Versailles made a great run, losing in the Round of 64 and thus winning 30,000 euros. It would be great to see another run in the cup this year, but the most important thing, as acknowledged by the club’s president, is to avoid relegation in the National 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, I follow the games on twitter, as there appears to be no video to stream or television channel to watch for games at this level. But it would be fun to see a game in person, as the stadium is not too long of a journey from our house, and the matches are very cheap (about 5 euros) to attend. If Versailles starts winning games in the French Cup, or if they are able to start collecting points in the National 2, you might find me in the stands.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">Though I always am happy when Paris Saint-Germain is doing well, they are a team which is expected to win everything in France, and to compete for European titles.

The theory is related to understanding the main philosophies of a culture, and evaluating the quality of life in that culture. What happened recently, was that an ATM swallowed up my bank card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not really a rare occurence in France. Machines will always first ask what kind of operation the user wants to perform, such as a withdrawal or something else. Then, the machine will ask for the PIN for the bank card, in order to validate the operation. If the user fails to get the PIN code correct after a few tries, not only is the operation not permitted, but the card is also kept by the machine, with the theory that the user doesn’t deserve to get the card back, since the user wasn’t able to enter the correct PIN and therefore the card might be stolen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logic itself is not perfect. It is definitely very security-minded. It is not the only way that the French ATM can decide to take your bank card. Years ago, I was getting cash in Paris, and as the machine gave back the card, I was dealing with something in my bag. While I was doing that, the machine retracted the card and kept it. Unannounced to me, the machine was on a timer, and after about 60 seconds, decided that I had lost my chance to grab my card, and for security reasons, retracted it. I immediately went into the bank and asked someone to retrieve my card, only to be told I would have to come back the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the present day. Having lost my bank card to a French ATM once, I am pretty careful. But I made a mistake this time, as I selected the wrong account (we have a useless credit account accessible via the same bank card). Immediately after I made the mistake, I chose to cancel the operation. In order to do that, it seemed the only option was to request the bank card to be returned, so I did that. At this point, I had not yet entered the PIN for the card, as I had cancelled the operation before that step. It was probably for that reason that the machine refused to return my card. The next day I went into the corresponding bank, who told me they were unable to retrieve the card, as the machine was one not located at their branch, but rather in a shopping center across town. I had to go to my bank and order a new bank card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my mind, evaluating these events leads to an understanding of the philosophy behind French culture at its core. The physical world runs on money, and for individuals, that money is held at the bank. Understanding the philosophy of how the bank works is understanding the philosophy of the culture. French banks offer equality in their services, and offer perks such as being able to use any ATM, from any bank, without a fee. Meanwhile, having a bank card incurs a monthly fee. The only banks which I know of offering free bank cards with their accounts are online-only banks. Transferring money to another account is limited to small amounts when done at a bank branch. Perhaps most notably, the bank branch at which the account was created is the branch to which the user must go to talk to their advisor, or perform more complicated operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conclusion is that the French bank is equal for all in its imposition of inconveniences and fees. Recently, my bank in France refused to allow me to increase my monthly payments on my mortgage, citing my salary as being too low. My salary needs to be about three times the monthly payment, regardless of the amount. So if I am making ten thousand euros a month, I can only pay the bank a third of that, despite the fact that I don’t need two thirds of that amount for daily life. It’s a blanket rule imposed on everyone to keep us safe from ourselves. We can’t be trusted to make our decisions with our money, for fear we might starve ourselves by paying back the loan too quickly. It’s not even a matter of the bank getting more interest by keeping the loan term longer, as the amount of interest we pay now is miniscule since the bank front-loaded it into the loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, this is what stands out about French culture. Central control, security above else, no risks at all if possible. Arguably, we profit from this sometimes as we are foreigners who might encounter pitfalls due to simply not knowing how things work sometimes. On the other hand, once we learn how things work, it is still inconvenient, if not impossible, to do what we want to do. Often, problems cannot be solved by money or knowledge. I heard someone once say that of &lt;em&gt;Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité&lt;/em&gt;, equality was the main emphasis in France, whereas in the United States, liberty is most valued thing. I find that to be quite true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in America, I opened up a bank account in Oklahoma, where I went to college for one semester. I never again visited that bank branch, and I never had to, because everything was online. My bank card was free, but I couldn’t use it at other banks’ ATMs without incurring a fee. I eventually had privileged accounts because I had enough funds to qualify for them, meaning I gained slightly more interest, and had a few more options. If I knew the rules of the game, I could profit by them. I’m reminded of a great bit by comedian Louis C.K., in which the man with insufficient funds has his few dollars taken from him and given to the rich man as his interest. Clearly, not everyone profits from the way American banks operate. Many people do not play the game, do not follow the rules, or are simply unlucky. But there is a game to be played, by which a person can profit. This is the way I grew up, believing that I was special, and that if I played my cards right, I could do whatever I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually started developing my theory years ago while living in China. Chinese banks are notoriously difficult for foreigners. They’re designed to be that way. Foreigners have great difficulty doing anything more complicated than using the ATM, because foreigners don’t have Chinese documents. It took us from lunch to dinner sitting in a bank branch to close my account the last time I was in China. This reflects the attitude to foreigners in Chinese culture. Foreigners are just that, outsiders who are to be inconvenienced and frustrated at every turn, to be kept out of all institutions if possible, to not be allowed to enter into Chinese culture. But Chinese banks aren’t just poor for foreigners. Though the average Chinese person may not be discriminated against specifically, employers can choose which bank their employees must use to access their paychecks. Doing any sort of complicated operation like a transfer requires a significant amount of time spent at a bank branch filling out forms. To me, the suffering people go through at the bank is paralleled by the suffering that people endure in Chinese culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, not every aspect of culture can be seen at the bank. My theory is rather general and only tested in China, the USA, and France. Yet I find that it tends to hold up pretty well in those scenarios. Now that I’ve been in France for several years, I hope that sooner rather than later, the bank will allow a little more &lt;em&gt;Liberté&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">A couple of things which happened to me recently reminded me of a theory which I had been developing for some time.

I’ve always been interested in navigating rivers via canoe and kayak as a form of exploration, which is how I came across Jim Baird’s YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim and his brother Ted were on the fourth season of the television show “Alone” on the History Channel. They won the first prize of $500,000 for that season by surviving by themselves for 75 days, longer than the 6 other pairs of contestants. Jim and Ted both have channels which showcase the different adventures that they have been on. Jim is married, Ted is engaged, and the brothers sometimes go on adventures with their significant others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adventures that Jim has been on include trekking across the snow and ice from Qikiqtarjuaq to Pangnirtung with sleds and his faithful dog Buck, who has now sadly passed. Most of Jim and Ted’s adventures are canoeing and kayaking. Often, they will get a bush pilot with a seaplane to fly them out into a very remote section of wilderness, and they will paddle back to an outpost of civilization. That was the case when Jim did the Hess River in the middle of the Yukon territory, and when both brothers and their partners did the Mountain River in the Northwest Territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I like the most about the content that the Baird brothers put out is that it is lengthy. I can get a good sense of the lifestyle they are living when they are out in the bush, because they have over thirty minutes of coverage per day, sometimes almost an hour even. Most other adventure and exploration content that I have seen would put out about 5 minute to 10 minutes maximum per day, and would fit a trip of a week or two into about an hour. Jim and Ted actually have playlists of hours of video for most of their trips. I like this longer content. I can always skip ahead if I really want to, but I never find myself bored by watching an hour of exploration, even if the distance covered is less on average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these long videos, Jim and Ted showcase their skills on longer expeditions. They are good fishermen, and often fish just for enjoyment, releasing their catch. They spend a lot of time showing the maintenance of their campsites, complete with the collection of wood for campfires, the cooking process, and all the other tasks which they perform while camping. It is a very different style to an ultralight trip. The Baird brothers bring lots of gear, which can make for difficult hauls in the event of a portage, but also gives them the ability to do a lot more things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The style of their expeditions is definitely not a fast-based race from beginning to end. It’s more of a slower, canoe camping adventure in which the brothers spend time eating breakfast, packing up camp, and making their way downriver to the next campsite. That’s not a knock on their style, it’s just a big difference in planning compared to my backgrand in ultralight hiking. Watching their adventures has definitely made me think about the difference between the two, and how both styles have validity in certain situations. Certainly, I can see that when out in the deep wilderness, more gear ensures more safety and more ability to deal with unforeseen issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes time to plan and execute an expedition. There is also a lot of time needed to edit film and publish the content. As such, it was easy for me to watch most of the content Jim and Ted have put on their channels in just a few weeks. I’ll be checking back in regularly to see what they are doing. I’m looking forward to seeing new adventures from them. If you enjoy a realistic look at wilderness adventure, I would definitely recommend checking out their stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">Now that I’ve finished the first version of the route for the Northern Divide Trail, and have updated all the associated resources, I’ve turned to other things.

During this time I’ve been busily reviewing the route, reviewing the resources, and making small changes. Right now, the trail is complete. The resources have been updated to their latest version, and a new resource, a textual guide, has been added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text guide is useful as a secondary resource. Broken down into days, the guide gives step-by-step directions for walking the trail. Each day includes directions which explain in plain text how to hike the trail, based on compass directions and geographical features such as streams, creeks, rivers, valleys, mountains, and passes. In addition, each day has an abbreviated table of the notable geographical features. Finally, at the bottom of the page for each day, there is an elevation profile. This gives the reader a realistic look at the hike for the day, and gives an estimate as to what to expect in terms of difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the addition of this lengthy text file, I’e also updated the KMZ (Keyhole Markup) file, created in Google Earth. This is the file which serves as the definition of the trail’s route. I was able to shorten the trail a little bit, and reduce the number of days recommended to hike the trail by increasing the distance for each day up to 40 kilometers, whenever possible. I also took a considerable amount of time to shorten parts of the trail that were more winding. The end result is that the trail is now just 1000 kilometers long, and is divided into just 26 days. While this certainly increases the average distance planned for each day, it allows for more time to spend resting in the few resupply points along the way. The reduced timeframe also helps to finish the trail by the end of the best season for hiking, which is probably September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the topographical maps are updated to accompany the updated route. This file is large, and can be downloaded directly from the drive. With maps at 1:20000 specification, this resource is good for finding the route in relation to geographical features. The route is traced, and the recommended end of each day is also marked. There are enough maps that each day is covered by about two maps on average. The maps are taken directly from the provincial governmen of British Columbia. Very often, the map at the edges of two connecting pages overlap, so it should be easy to trace the route from page to page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three of these resoures have been updated with proposed side trails to Pink Mountain, Tsay Keh Dene, and Kwadacha. These are the only place to replenish supplies between the Pine and Toad Rivers, which is the biggest haul of the trail if done without resupplying between the two. Reduced now to 15 days, this stretch can theoretically be traversed without taking a four (or more) day detour to one of the above options, but it is still long, and contains some tall mountains which must be climbed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Toad River, I played with several differetn attemps to avoid the steep climbs and descent around Nonda Peak, without any success. Alternatives involved just as much cumulative elevation change, and passed outside of the core of the mountain range. As such, this area near the Northern end of the trail may be the most tricky to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a good time making the plan for this trail. Planning and calculating logistics is a big part of hiking. Planning a trail is entirely about that same type of preparation, which I enjoy.

The things that really interest me deeply endure more than just a few weeks, and become bigger than just a passing interest. There are other things that I find interesting for awhile, but after a few weeks I feel I’ve pretty much exhausted the material available or my initial interest has not developed into anything more. With that in mind, I thought I would create a series of posts that I can come back to occasionally, highlighting my latest interest, usually marked by the kind of videos I’ve been watching lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, it’s Disc Golf. I got into disc golf a little bit after playing a few times on vacation this summer. I don’t think I ever came close to shooting under par, but I still enjoyed it. I’m not really able to throw the disc straight. Instead, my best shot curves to the left, which is probably very common for right-handed people. Therefore, any hole that has obstacles on the right side is a big problem, since I need to throw a bit to the right to account for the left curve. I still had fun, but definitely wished I could be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I ended up finding professional disc golf videos on the internet. In truth, I don’t know how lucrative playing disc golf is. I would guess that many of those who play it are not making a lot of money, but are able to make a little bit, and play just because they love the game. There are definitely a select few who are well-paid, though. The players that play in the professional tour seem to be really good. On average, I would guess that the holes demand about 150 feet per stroke on average to make it to the hole. When you consider that the limit for most players to make a putt is around 40 feet, that means that players often need to throw three hundred feet off the tee, without hitting obstacles or going out of bounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distance isn’t the only issue. Disc golf players have a whole set of different methods of throwing the disc. These are needed to be ready for different wind conditions or terrain features. The classic frisbee throw that I know, called a backhand, is merely one way. There is also the forehand. Then there is the Hyzer, which is when the disc angles left, or Anhyzer, when it angles right. There are many other ways to throw the disc, and there are many types of disc as well. Just like golf, there are drivers, mid-range discs, putters, and many other types in between. For someone like me who basically just knows frisbees, it’s all a bit much to take in, but the pros are able to pick out the right disc for the right situation, depending on distance and risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The videos I’ve been watching have almost all been by a channel called JomezPro. I have to give this channel a lot of credit. The production value is really high for these videos. It feels like I’m watching the sport on cable television. In a sport where it’s critical to get not only a view of the throw but also the landing spot, which is often over a hundred yards away, JomezPro manages to switch seamlessly between takes to make the experience make sense to the viewer, and keep a global view of the hole while still getting all the action in close-up shots. The rounds are well-filmed, and the graphics clearly track the players’ progress. The fact that all this content is available on the internet really highlights the advantage of internet video channels over television, where there are many more hoops to getting content to prospective viewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think what is great about disc golf is that everyone knows about frisbees, and everyone knows about golf. But watching golf can be a bit boring, because many people like me have never hit a golf ball, and don’t really understand how difficult it is. Watching disc golf is a bit more down-to-earth, and it is much easier to understand the challenges of putting together a series of disc throws to perfectly place the disc in the basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now, I’ve seen a lot of rounds of disc golf, so I may dial back my time spent watching a little bit. Sadly there really isn’t much of any disc golf in France, so I can’t really play the game myself. I haven’t really lost interest, though I do think I may have outpaced the amount of disc golf being played, and may need to wait a bit for new tournaments to be played and uploaded to the channel. It isn’t often that I’m interested enough in a sport to get into it this much, so I’m just enjoying this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">I have the type of personality that leads me to get hung up on a subject for a few weeks and dive into it for awhile, before moving on to the next thing.

We’re lucky to be in France for this period, where the COVID-19 pandemic is under control and children are able to go to school without too many disruptions. After our vacation in the United States this summer, it was obvious that this was not going to be the case there. I’ve seen images of children as young as 5 years old in front of a computer screen at their house for their first day of Kindergarten. As a parent I can’t imagine that situation, and am so happy it won’t be the case for our family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heading back to school is a fun time. It’s the moment when we get all new school supplies, with that new Back to School smell. The pencils are sharp, the folders are unblemished, and the papers are all blank, ready for work to be done. Our daughter Miriam loves getting that stuff. In addition, as fall approaches, it’s a nostalgic time when we think back to previous Back to School moments, and how much we have to look forward to this school year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French school year starts the first week of September, and never before. In fact this year, Miriam goes to school on the 1st of September, which is a Tuesday. French children start later than many Americans, who are already in school by mid or late August, but they end much later, typically the first week of July. Even more different, this year Miriam’s school has removed those last few days in July and has replaced them with Saturday mornings. This is not completely unheard of in France. I’m not sure how well it would go over back in the States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French kids get a lot of vacations to keep them in school until the end of June. They get two weeks off for Halloween, Christmas, Winter, and Easter, respectively. That divides the year up into periods of about six or seven weeks, with two week vacations between them. In elementary school, and perhaps middle school, French schoolchildren also stay home on Wednesdays. As parents it’s not really ideal, and many mothers who work have either negociated a schedule on which they don’t work on Wednesdays, or have found a caretaker for Wednesdays, and often other days as well, to pick the kids up from school. It’s definitely a complaint I have with the French system, which I see as hurting the family, as well as creating a sort of underclass of immigrant or poor babysitters. We’re lucky to have my wife at home to deal with this schedule, but it definitely isn’t ideal to constantly have the schoolyear be broken up by two week periods of vacation, after which Miriam is more reluctant to go back to school, or for her to be home every Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be Miriam’s third and final year of Ecole Maternelle, which is like Preschool. This year, Grande Section, is the equivalent of Kindergarten in the USA. On the one hand, I think it’s exciting that she’s finally the same age I was when I first went to school, but on the other hand, it’s a little anticlimatic since she has already been going to school for two years, and is still in Maternelle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, we’re excited to start the school year, partly because it will mean Miriam will get back to school to interact more in French, and will leave my wife a bit more peace and quiet at the house. Obviously with the COVID-19 pandemic and schools being out for much of last year, she has dealt with two little kids at the house for months extra. This will be a nice break for her, albeit not a real break since she still has our son Daniel with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know the first day is always difficult. No matter what Miriam says in the days leading up to the First Day of School, she is reluctant to the point of tears to leave the house on that morning. As the week progresses, she is quickly reminded of how much she enjoys school, and is okay to leave the house. We’re looking forward the most to that time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">Now that it is the end of August, the Back to School season is upon us.
