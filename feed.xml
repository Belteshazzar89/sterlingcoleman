My interest in Paradox came when I started playing Europa Universalis 4, a game which really deserves its own post. That is probably Paradox’s most well-known and successful game, and thoug I knew that they had done other games such as Crusader Kings, I never jumped at the chance to play any of their other games. That changed recently when I found a bundle on the wonderful site Humble Bundle to buy Stellaris and some extra content for a low price. I decided to take the offer, and I haven’t regretted it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the games that I enjoy are strategy games. Games in which I can control some territory and build a civilization are always fun. Most of the games that I had played in this genre focused on ancient times: Age of Empires, Civilization (which I find more fun in the early stages), and Europa Universalis, which is not ancient but certainly medieval. I had some interest in trying the same context in a futuristic setting, which led me to buy Master of Orion years ago. That was an interesting game, though flaxed. Stellaris far surpasses it, and really meets my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much more than just Europa Universalis in space, Stellaris has a all the basic elements of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X&quot;&gt;4X game&lt;/a&gt;, but with some story elements as well. As the game progresses, events occur which can shape the outlook of your civilization, and there is a lot of good science fiction writing that makes the archeological finds and scientific discoveries interesting. To me, this is the mark of a good space game. Because the game is in the future, naturally it is fiction, and being in space, it’s science fiction, which is a difficult genre for which to write a story. The events have to be beyond the current experiences of humanity, but also believable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the ways that Stellaris stays interesting is by simply having so many dimensions. Other games that I know in this genre have types of planets and different civilizations, each with specific characteristics. Stellaris has that, but also has more sophisticated systems for planet, resource, and population management. The exploration and discovery process is a little more detailed, and there are simply more types of non-playable entities in the galaxy, with fallen empires, merchant groups, hostile drones, and more all being not unimportant pieces of the galactic picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technological tree is vast, and there are ways to play the game “tall” instead of just “wide”, meaning that there are viable strategies to sticking to a small piece of territory and not expanding. This is an important subject for any 4X game, as most fail to come up with alternatives to the typical strategy of expanding infinitely in order to control more resources. That is still one possibility in Stellaris, but the player can also stick to the few planets surrounding the homeworld, and vastly increase the population on these planets, all while remaining competitive with those empires covering many more systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would definitely recommend Stellaris to anyone interested in this genre, who also enjoys science fiction. If the futuristic aspect is not important, there are already many other games that do exploration and civilization-building quite well. Concerning Stellaris, I haven’t seen any game that has accomplished as much in an engaging futuristic science fiction galaxy while retaining everything great about the empire-building games that I have come to enjoy the most.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">Given how much I’ve played this game in recent months, it’s only fair that I spend some time talking about my interest in one of Paradox Interactive’s games.

As parents, the apprehension of our children to going to school is balanced directly by our joy in sending them. This year is the big year for us, as not only is our daughter Miriam starting CP (Cours préparatoire), which is the first year of elementary school, but we also are sending our son Daniel to Petite Section for his first year of preschool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the moment that we have been waiting for, for about a year. During this time Daniel has been constantly asking when he can go to school like his big sister. Well, that day has finally come. As a parent I had been steeling myself for that first day, knowing that no matter how excited Daniel seemed to be to go to school, he would feel differently when he actually got there. Somehow, on the way to school I allowed myself to believe that maybe things would be different with Daniel, and he would be happy to be at school for the first time. Sadly, I was wrong in my thinking, and Daniel cried, just like most children, as he realized that being at school means being separated from his parents, and meeting new people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, however, things have progressed rapidly. Given that this is our second go-round, we have been doing our best to prepare Daniel for school by getting him to watch videos in French, speaking to him in French occasionally, and of course getting him to play with Miriam and her friends, who speak French together. This is a big improvement on our preparations for Miriam’s first day at school three years ago, when she entered the classroom for the first time with minimal French language skills. This, and the difference in personality, may have contributed to Daniel’s quite acclimatization to the school environment. After just one month, Daniel now walks into the classroom on his own accord, without pouting or whining. As a parent, it is a huge relief to be able to get the children to school without a lot of whining, and without having to spend energy hyping the kids up for school, or trying to distract them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, given that both children are now in school, my wife Alex is finally free for most of the day, to do what she wants to do. This is a much-deserved break after six years of raising children all day, every day. She finally can do the things that can’t be done with kids, like simply going for a run, or do things which would be much more difficult with children, like going into Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel is not the only one undergoing a big change. Miriam’s schooling is more serious than before, and as she learns to read and write French in school, we are doing our best to complement that with English and Chinese learning at home. Meanwhile, we’ve also picked out one extracurricular activity, gymnastics, for her to do on Wednesdays, when there is no school, as well as on Friday evenings. It feels good to see her doing something she enjoys with other kids, and we are so lucky to live a few minutes’ walk from the practice gym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a father, it’s important to be leading our familiy to grow in a smooth and constant manner, and this Back to School season definitely feels like that. With both kids now in school, I can see our family transitioning into a new phase, and it’s a wonderful thing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">With all of the other topics that I wanted to share, I haven’t yet had a chance to write about the start of a new school year.

Recently, while playing around on Google Maps, I was thinking how it would be interesting to attempt to cross the enormous peninsula formed by Northern Québec and Labrador by kayak or canoe, thus connecting the Hudson Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. By map, we can see roughly that there are rivers which descend in both direction from the large lakes in the center of this area, and thus it should be possibile. It was thus with glee that I found that Justin Barbour had already set out on this exact adventure and had put together a compelling series of videos covering his trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that I like about Justin is that he labels himself “Newfoundland Explorer”, advertising his roots in the wild Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. I finished my ECT hike in Newfoundland and got a glimpse of Labrador across the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. I loved the wild feeling of emptiness and the raw beauty of that land, and was always interested to see more of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justin and his trusty sidekick Saku the dog have done several adventures in Newfoundland and Labrador. Besides the aforementioned undertaking to take a canoe up the Red Wine River from Labrador and then make it all the way to Kuujjuarapik on the shores of the Hudson Bay, he also trekked by foot and packraft across Southern Newfoundland, and just recently put out trailers for a new series in Newfoundland’s Northern Peninsula. Justin travels by a variety of methods in his various adventures, most often by foot and canoe, though he often has to adapt these means to the conditions, such as snowshoeing or pulling a sled in winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of the content that he puts out makes Justin Barbour an adventurer slightly different from others that I have watched in the past. Usually, I’m interested in a series in which we cover a sizeable distance each day and during the entire trip, but several of the adventures that Justin does are in more of a wilderness survival style, in which there is a defined goal and route to achieve that, but each day he takes time to fish, take care of Saku, and enjoy the land at a slower pace than a simple dash to the finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more enjoyable is Justin’s attitude throughout his time in the wild. He never appears stressed or anxious, instead choosing to tackle imposing challenges with an eager attitude. The trip across Labrador struck me as a particularly tiring adventure, as Justin dragged his canoe upriver for weeks on end. Having conquered the mental aspect of life out in the wild, Justin can really enjoy the wilderness and make the viewer feel that they are on a simple camping trip, briefly forgetting that the surroundings are completely uninhabited and rarely visited by people, and that Justin is often far from any town or person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This enjoyable difference in Justin’s attitude is what makes his camping-style videos so enjoyable. Whereas most camping doesn’t interest me, seeing Justin and Saku camping out on a North Atlantic island for a long period is actually one of the more interesting video series, because of the atmosphere. These types of videos make survival camping seem convivial, as Justin takes care of his daily business out in the bush with a smile. I’m looking forward to seeing more from Justin Barbour and Saku, as they inevitably become more popular and take on grander adventures.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">It’s not often for me to find a series of adventures that really captures my attention these days, as many of the popular trips we find on the internet are road trips or rather mundane adventures that never enter into truly remote territory.

Kevin and Emma had met years before, but hadn’t started dating until later on. Very soon after the engagement, plans were made to have the wedding sooner rather than later. Having had a short engagement period myself, I admired the willingness to commit to marriage once the decision was made. We had our tickets to fly to the United States (along with Kevin, who came to do Mont Blanc), and were excited to be witness to this great event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we weren’t merely witnesses. Kevin had already honored me by asking me to be the Best Man at his wedding, and I had been working on my speech, though it wasn’t finished yet. Our daughter Miriam was the flower girl, and our son Daniel was the ring bearer. Not only that, but Kevin and Emma had recently bought a house, and offered to let us stay there in the week prior to the wedding. We found their house to be wonderful, with an all-new interior and a big back yard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, we got to spend time with Emma, something we had only done via video chat in the months prior to the wedding. Even over video, we loved Emma and couldn’t wait to meet her, and that feeling was confirmed when we met in person. It was a shame that Emma had to work in the days leading up to the wedding, and of course had much to do to prepare for the big day. Thankfully, we’ll have plenty of time to spend with her and Kevin in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our part, we helped as much as we could with the physical preparations. My wife did a lot of cleaning and preparations in the house. I made myself busy setting up the tents which formed the corridor and space for the meal after the ceremony. The day of the reception, we found that Kevin’s car would not start, so I set about investigating and eventually replacing the battery. We were happy to be of some help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our children got their fair share of playtime with their grandparents. They went out to a few small parks with playgrounds, they rode a pair of bicycles which my mother thoughtfully brought down from Virginia, and my brother and I took them to a nice splashpad run by the city for a small price. It was quite hot during our stay, and perfect for the splashpad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reception was nice, as we got to meet many of Kevin’s friends and Emma’s sisters and parents. We had a nice meal and got to listen to some great toasts. My own toast as Best Man had been postponed until after the wedding due to scheduling difficulties with one of the groomsmen, who happened to be our old soccer coach from high school, and his difficulties in getting down to South Carolina for the reception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, Kevin and I met up with other groomsmen for a round of disc golf. Kevin was the best, having practiced quite a lot, but we all had fun. I managed a couple of good shots and even a long putt or two (for me), and then we had lunch and got ready for the wedding. Kevin had graciously paid for our outfits, which were nice shirts, pants, vests, and bowties. Coach Verbrugge tied all the bowties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ceremony was beautiful. Miriam and Daniel performed their parts beautifully. It was a great feeling to be standing right next to my brother as he got married, and to have our families there as well. With the vows and rings exchanged, Kevin and Emma enjoyed a triumphant kiss and we all filed back to the house for drinks and snacks befor the final meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening we ate, and we got to listen to the rest of the toasts. I had worked a lot on mine, and was proud to give Kevin and Emma a memorable toast for their big day. As the evening wound down with dancing, we congratulated Kevin and Emma again as they left for a honeymoon in Iceland. For our part, we were so happy to have been there to witness their love for each other, and the beginning of a beautiful life together.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">The big event this summer was the August wedding ceremony for my brother Kevin, and his fiancée Emma.

I was in middle school at The Covenant School, a great private Christian school in Charlottesville, Virginia. The school was finishing up a brand new campus that we would later move to for the rest of my middle and high school years, but at that time, I had just started seventh grade, which was the year I changed from the Lower School to the Upper School. The Upper School was at the old McIntire High School building, an old building with the old-style radiators, old-style lockers, and lots of other old things. I had done my Kindergarten year in that building before the Lower School was moved to the Mountainwood facility, which was previously some sort of healthcare or recovery facility. Nevertheless, the move back to the McIntire building was a complete change of style, and I was still getting used to it in mid-September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were in chapel, a weekly timeslot on Tuesdays, when the school gathered in the gymnasium to worship. The worship was interrupted by the headmaster of the school, who made the announcement of the terrorist attack. As a seventh grader, I understood that the situation was serious, but I couldn’t really place the event in the timeline of world events, or predict the events that would follow. One girl in our class left the room in tears, as her father was a pilot who had flown to New York that morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the school day, most of our classes consisted of watching the news, talking about events with our teachers. I specifically remember the math teacher attempting to go through the lesson, but stopping soon, presumably because she was too distracted. I don’t remember too many other specific moments related to the tragedy. I remember the local paper, The Daily Progress, put out a special issue, which I had never seen before. For a seventh grader, life went on without too many changes. I was excited about my Game Boy Advance and the soon-to-be-released GameCube. I still went to soccer practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s now 2021. Twenty years have passed, and America has gone into and out of Afghanistand and Iraq. The orchestrator of the attacks has long since been found and killed, and the world has moved on to deal with a series of other similar, although smaller, attacks and attempts to terrorize. In my mind, the most impactful effects inside the United States was the passage of the Patriot Act and other similar measures, all designed to increase security and protect against threats by increasing surveillance powers. Outside the USA, the most obvious impacts were the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. For me personally, the effect of the attacks has not been too dire. Mostly, it’s just an inconvenience to be in an atmosphere of increased security. There are more hoops to jump through to get things done. I can’t bring a laptop into the American Embassy in Paris, I have to deposit it at a hotel around the block. Every country has stepped up security to some extent, and most countries have followed America’s example of increased surveillance and reduced privacy rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the abscence of serious personal links to the attacks, I look at the bigger picture. Perhaps the biggest effect on me is simply being an American. Everyone has an opinion on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and some people like to tell me their opinion when they find out that I’m American. Only America’s closest allies followed its lead in responding to the terrorist threats to the extent that the United States had hoped for, and thus relations have not improved between the USA and most of Europe. In a sense, the effects of the attack have been long-lasting on the global scale, as America is only just now scaling back its involvement in the world, a process which it could have started much earlier, instead of attempting various endeavors in the Middle East which have largely not been supported by the rest of the developed world, or the nations of the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, September 11 was a terrible tragedy, but one that was very likely to happen (although not necessarily on that scale) as globalization increased and the difference between the United States and the rest of the world became more evident. There was always going to be a conflict eventually, and the United States was very likely to respond. As a seventh grader, the attacks didn’t have a big effect on me personally, mostly because of the United States’ power to project force across the globe, and because of its strong economic, political, and governmental structures in place, which were able to respond to the attacks without seriously interrupting life for its citizens (despite increased surveillance). Mostly, 9/11 is an event to commemorate, a date to reflect on, but one on which we reflect on from a position of comfort and security.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">Like most people who can remember September 11, 2001, I remember first and foremost where I was when the news broke. I was in middle school at The Covenant School, a great private Christian school in Charlottesville, Virginia. The school was finishing up a brand new campus that we would later move to for the rest of my middle and high school years, but at that time, I had just started seventh grade, which was the year I changed from the Lower School to the Upper School. The Upper School was at the old McIntire High School building, an old building with the old-style radiators, old-style lockers, and lots of other old things. I had done my Kindergarten year in that building before the Lower School was moved to the Mountainwood facility, which was previously some sort of healthcare or recovery facility. Nevertheless, the move back to the McIntire building was a complete change of style, and I was still getting used to it in mid-September.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Success on Mont Blanc: Part 3</title><link href="/blog/2021/09/success-mont-blanc-part-3.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Success on Mont Blanc: Part 3" /><published>2021-09-04T12:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-09-04T12:00:00+02:00</updated><id>/blog/2021/09/success-mont-blanc-part-3</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2021/09/success-mont-blanc-part-3.html">&lt;p&gt;In the very early hours of the morning, everyone else in the hut got up and started their ascent to the summit. I woke up later and noticed that the wind was howling outside. Refuge Goûter sits on the edge of a cliff, which makes for an incredible view, albeit in high winds. When Kevin woke up, he noticed the same thing, and we were both happy that we hadn’t attempted a summit in those conditions. Kevin was already feeling very sore, and a summit attempt at 3AM in high winds didn’t seem like a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got up and packed up my stuff. My brother got up a little later and got packed up. We both ate as much of our food as we could, as we wouldn’t need much on the descent. We finally got going around 9:30 AM, as the first people to summit that day were returning to the refuge. It was quite windy, and we were glad to be heading down, instead of being blasted on the snowy ridgelines of the upper mountain. I got our harnesses hooked up with a rope, and put everything else away in order to manage that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The descent from Goûter down to Tête Rousse was time consuming for us. We took extreme caution, and backed down most of the mountain. I used the rope to ensure that Kevin had an extra failsafe as he was still feeling sore, but he never ended up needing it. It is quite intimidating when you stare down the mountain for a distance and can barely see your destination far below. We tried not to do that, instead preferring to focus on just the next few steps, taking each problem on one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that was a little odd for me, was that Kevin was consistently feeling a little cold on the trip, whereas I was the opposite. Even on the descent, where I wasn’t exerting myself, I immediately took off my coat and descended in just a long sleeve shirt and gloves. We encouraged each other and psyched ourselves up during the descent in order to stay sharp. The mental game was just as important as the physical aspect, which consisted just of finding the right spots for feet and hands to cling onto the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon enough other groups passed us by, as they sped down the mountain. We were no longer phased by this. Our success on Mont Blanc was not determined by our speed, but by getting all the way up to Refuge Goûter with no guide and no prior mountaineering experience, and getting down the mountain safely while slightly injured, all without needing a rescue operation. We kept descending, and eventually Tête Rousse stopped being a dot in the distance, and it grew quite close. There started to be more sections which we could walk normally, without backing down the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it to Tête Rousse, and took a brief break after taking off our crampons and stowing the harnesses and rope. We were pretty much safe. The descent from there down to the Eagle’s Nest and the tramway took a long time, and I finished off a fantastic sunburn, but they were not dangerous. We took our time as my brother’s injuries were starting to aggravate him, but we did make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally back in town, we managed to offload our gear and make it to the hotel. I could finally exhale and feel good about getting off the mountain safely. It’s true that we didn’t summit, and that is a real shame. If I had thought that there was any way to do it safely and get back down the mountain, I would have gone for it. The reality is, we made the right decision, even though it hurt. As it happens, we took so long to get down the mountain, that even leaving at 9:30 AM, we didn’t exit the rental shop until 7 PM. We would have never made it to the summit and all the way back down. I call our trip a success from an amateur’s perspective. There were very few other groups attempting the mountain without a guide, and those that were, seemed to have more experience, and certainly had lighter packs than us. We did the best we could, and we came home safe, sound, and on time for my brother Kevin’s wedding. But that is a whole ‘nother story!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">In the very early hours of the morning, everyone else in the hut got up and started their ascent to the summit.

We had hiked upwards for 6 hours through rain and wind to get to the point at which most climbers start their trip after taking the tramway. The staff at the Eagle’s Nest was very kind, and we dried out a lot of our clothing. There were no other hikers there. We attempted to eat some, but I couldn’t stand the smell of the food. After a long day, I was anxious about continuing the trip the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night, my brother and I exchanged our thoughts and fears on the trip so far, and what was to come. I explained that I wasn’t afraid to end my ascent if I felt it was risky to continue. My brother had already scared me by entering the early stages of hypothermia on the trail above Bionnassay. I wanted to climb Mont Blanc, but I also wanted to avoid an injury or a helicopter rescue, of which there are many on the mountain every summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning, we slowly gathered our things and set out around 8:30 AM. We timed it well, as we ended up starting our climb out of the Eagle’s Nest at the same time that others were getting off the tramway and going on ahead of us. We followed them up the mountain, passing through a section with many loose rocks. We soon passed by the first pockets of snow, and had to make a slight correction in navigation to get back onto the path as it climbed towards Tête Rousse. The other hikers went on ahead of us. It was too difficult for us to keep up, even with older hikers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we were slow, we had the advantage of starting in the morning. This removed the concern of time, as we knew we had plenty of time to make our planned hike to Refuge Goûter. It was incredibly majestic as well as incredibly intimidating to be able to look high up and see this destination almost from the time that we left the Eagle’s Nest. The hike up to Tête Rousse was not easy, but not as difficult as the previous day. From there, we switched to crampons, put our helmets on, and stared at a long steep climb up to Refuge Goûter, towering above us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We trudged up the snow hill, and we passed through the famously dangerous Couloir de la Mort without even realizing it. The snowfall over the previous days had rendered this formidable obstacle harmless. After this, the climb was technical. We put away the hiking poles and got the ice axes out. We climbed up hand over hand, always grateful for any two consecutive steps that occurred without encountering a rock face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the going was slow. Every group we encountered passed us, including women and older men. We had larger packs than anyone else, and we took frequent breaks. Kevin was feeling very sore from the previous day, and was actually grateful to be doing a little technical climbing which involves the arms, and not purely legs. Nevertheless, the climb was very long. We must have spent 4 hours just climbing. By the time we made it all the way up to Refuge Goûter, it was 3:30 PM. We walked through a strong wind to get there, then collapsed into bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a nap, I got up and looked around. One of the first things I noticed was that the elevation of the refuge was not what I thought it was. I had believe that we had ascended to within 500 meters of the summit. In reality, we were still a full 1000 meters away. This was a huge blow, because that elevation change represented over half of the altitude we had gained that day. The hike to the summit would be tough, and on top of that we needed to descend all the way back to the bottom of the entire mountain, turn in our gear at the rental shop, and crash at a hotel for an early morning departure the next day. We really couldn’t afford to get stuck on the mountain and possibly miss our flight back to the US to get to Kevin’s upcoming wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we evaluated the difficulty we had just to ascend the 1500 meters each of the previous two days, and the energy we would need as we descended steeply from Refuge Goûter back to Tête Rousse, it became obvious that the safe choice would be to put our full energy into a safe descent of the mountain. This was disappointing, but I was glad to make this decision, because I was very concerned about the descent. When you are staring up the mountain, you can at least climb facing forward, and lean into the mountain. When descending, obviously the direction you are facing becomes a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the decision made to descend directly the following day instead of attempting what would have been a dangerous summit attempt for us, I was relieved. I think Kevin was more disappointed than I was, which I understood. He had flown from America with the goal of summitting Mont Blanc, but we just weren’t in good enough physical shape, and we had brought a little too much clothing. We also had a little too much food with us, but not by a lot. In any case, we knew that we would not be getting up at 3AM to start a summit attempt with everyone else, so we relaxed in bed and prepared for a morning descent the next day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">We were exhausted both physically and emotionnaly when we arrived at the Eagle’s Nest.

Taking a break has been refreshing, and I’ve been busy with a lot of different things. Now that I have a free moment, I’d like to recount the adventure of climbing Mont Blanc with my brother Kevin at the beginning of August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have mentioned previously, Kevin had recruited me for this trip over a year before, and we had spent a lot of time preparing reservations and researching the logistics. On Tuesday, August 3, he flew into Paris, and we met up. First we got his American vaccine card translated into a French QR code in the TousAntiCovid app, allowing him to access any locations requiring proof of a vaccination or a negative COVID test. After getting off work, we hastily transferred everything we wouldn’t be taking to the mountain to my wife to take back to our house, and we travelled across Paris to get on our high-speed train to Lyon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We traversed Lyon on foot at midnight, still clutching our shopping bags full of gear and food, and found our hotel for the night. Up by 6AM the next morning, we took a series of regional trains to Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, one of the villages at the foot of Mont Blanc. Just getting from the train station to the rental gear shop was a challenge. I made a big mistake by following Google Maps through a park, which led us up a steep and muddy footpath. Our large bag handles were difficult to manage with pure arm strength, and by the time we made it up to the top, I was soaked in sweat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t have much time to commiserate, as we needed to get to Unlimited Sports to rent our mountaineering gear before it closed for lunch. We did finally arrive, and started the long process of getting all of our gear, and receiving instructions on every piece. The owner of the shop was helpful and took the time to make sure we understood how everything worked, and that we were prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we were ready to leave the village, it was already 1PM. I called the the Eagle’s Nest hut, were we had a reservation for the night, to confirm that we could arrive after the normal 5PM limit. I was told that anything before 7PM was fine. With this taken care of, we stocked up on water and left on a long walk up to the Eagle’s Nest. I had asked my brother if we could do this instead of simply taking the tramway, as I wanted the experience of climbing the entire mountain. We had already walked from the train station up to the upper portion of the village, and now we passed though Bionnay, and then Bionnassay. Bionnassay is a group of homes way up on the side of the mountain. Wearing our slightly unweildy mountaineering boots from the rental shop, we slowly made our way to this village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once up at the heart of Bionnassay, we saw a sign marking the Eagle’s Nest as being 3 hours and 50 minutes away by foot. It was already 4PM. We didn’t have much choice but to just continue trudging on, as we continued to climb up and up. Our packs felt heavy. At one point, I asked Kevin to take the 30-meter mountaineering rope for a time, as it was the heaviest thing I had, and I was feeling tired. The path up from Bionnassay to the Eagle’s Nest was very long. The portion just after leaving the village felt like a steep climb with our full packs. Of course, there was beauty all around us, which encouraged us to keep moving forward. As we continued on, each sign further on showed that we were reducing the gap and stood a chance of arriving at the refuge by 7PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last portion of the day, the slight drizzle we had been experiencing all day picked up. Combined with a stronger wind, Kevin was feeling pretty cold, and put on all his gear in order to stay safe. We had to cross a series of small streams and waterfalls which slowed us down a little bit, and there was just a non-stop climb that had our spirits low. After little sleep, Kevin’s jet lag, and heavy packs, we had had enough. Thankfully, the slog did eventually end, and we made it to the Eagle’s Nest about 60 seconds before 7PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be continued…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">Now that the summer is coming to an end, I’m finally getting back to my blog.

Mont Blanc is the highest mountain in Western Europe, or rather, the highest mountain in Europe not including the Caucasus, which contains several mountains which reach a higher elevation. At just over 4,800 meters, Mont Blanc reaches above Mount Whitney, the highest mountain in the continental United States, by almost 400 meters. I have good experience in hiking, but mountain climbing normally involves a different set of skills. While I may be at ease walking for days on end, if I were to do Mont Blanc, I would be exerting the maximum level of energy expended during a hike, continuously for atleast two days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I was happy to take on the proposed challenge. Right away, I dived into the research phase, which I believe is the most important phase of any adventure. I was happy to find that I could be of use for this sort of work, as I sifted through material only available in French, though there is also an abundant amount of information available in English. My brother had mentioned the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_du_Mont_Blanc&quot;&gt;Tour de Mont Blanc&lt;/a&gt;, but I quickly found that though that trail is very popular, it doesn’t go anywhere near the summit of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly fell upon the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go%C3%BBter_Route&quot;&gt;Goûter Route&lt;/a&gt;, which is the most popular and definitely the easiest route to the summit. The best part of the route may be that there are established shelters (refuges in French) along the route, the closest to the summit being the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refuge_du_Go%C3%BBter&quot;&gt;Refuge du Goûter&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, I started looking into booking a couple of spots at this shelter, and found immediately that it would not be so easy. It turns out that there are other people looking to summit Mont Blanc, and though the refuge is big considering its location, there simply aren’t enough spots for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reservation system is divided between spots saved for guides, and the general public. For the public, on certain dates and times, a limited number of spots open up. Thankfully, it’s not a complete free-for-all at those times, as the FFCAM (Fédération française des clubs alpins et de montagne) has put in place a waiting queue for those times. Unfortunately, the way in which this waiting queue works was not sufficiently clear to those of us who have never used the system, and my brother and I failed to get a spot on our first try. Thankfully, I was able to get a couple spots at Refuge du Goûter on the second and final reservation date, though the dates we got were not our first choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, the hardest and most important task in the preparation phase is complete. Since then, I have got all the train tickets and hotel rooms reserved, and the schedule is set. Now, I’m researching the difficulty of the route itself in order to prepare for eventual difficulties. I’ve seen some good videos which encapsulate the hike from Refuge Nid d’Aigle, at the end of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Blanc_tramway&quot;&gt;Mont Blanc Tramway&lt;/a&gt;, up to Refuge du Goûter. Clearly the most dangerous part of this portion of the climb is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Couloir_(Mont_Blanc)&quot;&gt;Grand Couloir&lt;/a&gt;, where falling and tumbling rocks are impossible to predict, and could be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Refuge du Goûter, we’ll be putting on crampons and climb through the snow and ice, being careful to avoid crevasses in the ice. The key is to stay on the established path at all times, leave early, and go slowly and carefully but without stopping. The weather conditions at the summit can be quite foggy with little or no visibility, which is a major hazard when the path is on a knife’s edge, both sides of which are steep ice slopes, on which a fall could be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though there are certainly dangers, the summit of a mountain as high as Mont Blanc is relatively easy, and can be done by those of us who are not technical experts in mountain climbing. Perhaps the best news for us is that there will be many other people on the mountain with us, the route is well-established, and we will be following directly in the footsteps of many other people. For now, I am concentrating on getting in good physical shape overall, to make sure that there are no issues on the summit day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">Months ago, my brother surprised me by proposing that we climb Mont Blanc together.

While I may be at ease walking for days on end, if I were to do Mont Blanc, I would be exerting the maximum level of energy expended during a hike, continuously for atleast two days.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Learning to Read, Write, and Speak</title><link href="/blog/2021/05/read-write-speak.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Learning to Read, Write, and Speak" /><published>2021-05-29T08:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-05-29T08:00:00+02:00</updated><id>/blog/2021/05/read-write-speak</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2021/05/read-write-speak.html">&lt;p&gt;I typically try not to write too much about my children. Bragging about them can be good in moderate amounts, but as the Western world has seen in the past few decades, many parents think that every little thing that their kids do is a big achievement. Not everything that a child does is a sign of a big improvement or new abilities. However, recently our daughter Miriam has progressed a lot in her reading and writing abilities, and our son Daniel has been speaking in longer and more complex sentences. That type of development is indeed a big improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miriam is not yet six years old, and in the French school system, she is in the last year of what I would call preschool. Real schoolwork doesn’t really begin until next year, when she enters the elementary school. Of course, her teachers do a lot of work with her right now too, and she has learned a lot at school. But as far as I know, she is not expected to be able to read or write full sentences on her own until next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our son Daniel is just three years old, so reading and writing is still a couple of years away. However, he has been making big improvements in his speaking ability. It used to be that he would just give a few words in response to a question or command. Now, he demonstrates an enjoyment in putting together longer statements. He’s starting to lose the baby voice and sound much more like our daughter or other children when he speaks. It’s difficult to explain the difference, but it’s obvious when we listen to him talk that he is enjoying speaking. Of course, we are a little wary that this could soon lead to the period that our daughter Miriam had at this age, at which time if she was awake, she was talking. But Daniel is a different person, and we’re happy that he is demonstrating an enjoyment of his new skills in verbal communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, what is most impressive about all of this is that both children are multilingual. In fact, the improvements which I have described in Miriam’s reading and writing are just what I have seen in English. I haven’t seen her reading in French, but I know that she can write a lot of basic French words already. Most interestingly, according to my wife her Chinese character writing has progressed a lot as well. Daniel may not be speaking a lot of French, but he does understand French, and he enjoys repeating the days of the week or counting to ten with his sister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a parent, improvements in communication skills are improvements worth celebrating. It makes our job a lot easier when communication is better. When Daniel can express himself, he cries less, which is a big relief for our nerves. As Miriam continues to improve her reading, she is entering a new phase in which she enjoys reading, and will read things by herself, making things easier for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, as a parent there is a simple satisfaction in seeing a change in our children, and watching them grow. Reading, writing, and speaking are all important skills on their own. Seeing improvements in those subjects in three different languages makes us very proud, and is part of the validation we feel as parents who have made an effort to provide the right learning environemnt to obtain these important skills.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">I typically try not to write too much about my children.
