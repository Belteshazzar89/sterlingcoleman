Given the time it takes to get there and back, and also knowing that she would be going with a friend, I knew that I had the children all to myself for the entire morning, until noon or even a little after. Little did I know that this Saturday morning would be an especially exciting time for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I might get lucky and be able to sleep in, but less than ten minutes after my wife had left the house, our son Daniel found me, and was upset that his mother was not there. Pretty soon his sister arrived as well, and we were all in bed together. I let them watch an old Asterix movie, which is a classic French cartoon, as well as a Wallace and Gromit film. I went to work on my computer, but after awhile was ready to get up, so I finally opened up the shutters, which is when I realized it had been snowing for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening up the shutters to a world of whiteness is a special feeling. It harkens back to childhood, waking up to a snow day, seeing that it had snowed overnight and the ground was no longer visible, being instead covered with a white blanket of snow. The children of course noticed the snow just as quickly. Once they saw that it, they were very excited, and immediately wanted to go out and play. Daniel, being just two years old, enjoyed simply staring out the window to watch the snow fall lightly into our back yard. Miriam preferred to pester me in constantly asking when we were going to go out to play. Daniel quickly joined in to make it a chorus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preparing children to go out in the snow is a pain. They have to have a lot of clothing on, but they don’t want it. Once they get outside and fall down, they complain that they are cold and wet. I was lucky in that the children didn’t complain too much when I insisted on several layers. Unfortunately, Miriam’s best coat was not waterproof, and I don’t know if we have snow gloves for anybody. We just went out with the best we could come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I immediately noticed was that my wife had not left any footprints in the snow when she left, meaning that in just a few hours, everything had been completely covered in snow. The next thing I remarked is that there are limited options for playing in the snow with small children. We ran around, hit the windows with a couple snowballs, and played hide and seek in the snow. I’m glad nobody tried to make a snow angel, although Daniel did slip and fall several times. After less than an hour playing outside, everyone was ready to go back into the house, where I finally succeeded in getting the fire going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would seem that I’ve turned into a bit of a Grinch since my youth, as I was very happy to be back inside and away from the snow. The main thing that I noticed about snow is that it is very cold and wet. While during my childhood I may have looked past this in order to go sledding, this weekend I mostly just wanted to avoid the cold and wet snow. Thankfully, the children had their fun and the snow was beautiful to watch from the comfort of our house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best part of the snow weekend for me was that it ended the next day. Today when I went out, the snow was completely gone from the roads, and elsewhere only a little remained. Snow is fun for a day, but when it bogs down school, work, and the commute during the week, it loses its charm. We had a good weekend in the snow, and made a few memories with the children. Even so, I’m happy that the snow weekend will remain just the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">On Saturday morning, my wife left the house early to head into Paris and get some specific items from a Chinese grocery store.

Although it is a bit painful to pay for the whole year up front, I prefer that to giving out bank account information for monthly payments. The choice to use the public transportation system exclusively puts us in the minority for middle class families well outside of Paris. In fact, we are the only family in our neighborhood without a car. Rather than go over why we don’t have a car, a topic which I’ve covered previously, I think it would be more interesting to explain the philosophy behind these types of decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a philosophy very similar to ultralight hiking, in which the hiker attempts to reduce the weight of the backpack and its contents by as much as possible. Just like a hiker has the capacity to carry weight, our family has the capacity to pay for things and to manage things. Also similarly to the hiker’s backpack, payments and the time needed to manage our affairs are a burden. When hiking ultralight, a person has to identify the things they absolutely must have, such as a sleeping bag, food, etc. and come up with a strategy to carry all the necessities while minimizing the weight. Nothing is an objective decision, as one could always argue about the necessity of some of the stuff a person carries, and if a lighter version of the gear is available, but with fewer features, etc. In life, we face the same type of decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can handle buying a car, and paying for insurance, and paying for gas, and paying for a driver’s license for my wife. We could pay for occasional repairs. A hiker could say the same type of thing, and many do. It always bothers me immensely when a hiker claims that there is more convenience or comfort to carrying a lot of luxury items. I remember when I met the first hiker who said that, in Southern Florida. He and his partner were taking a break to smoke because their 70 pound packs had tired them out after less than a mile into Big Cypress National Preserve. He saw my small pack and explained that they brought more stuff in order to be comfortable. The problem that ultralight hikers have identified with this is that the logic doesn’t add up. Distance hikers are obligated to spend more time hiking than camping, and it is decidedly inconvenient to carry a lot of stuff that does not get used much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The payments aren’t the only issue. Time spent managing things is a real drag. For example, I always cringe when I open up an application and see that it has included a hundred or so modules of all different types. Even if there are some strategies to minimize the burden of loading or build times, developers won’t even know when modules are no longer used, as there are simply too many to track. The bottom line is that we need to stop thinking if we can do the job by adding something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to figure out if it is possible to do the job without adding anything. If not, perhaps we can exchange something we currently use for something else which can do multiple things. For a hiker, that could be my stealth quilt, which served as a sleeping bag as well as a wearable down layer on the few occasions when the cold merited it. For my family, that could be a trailer for my bicycle, which I can use to get groceries, Christmas trees, or packages. It’s not a lot of fun getting groceries with the bicycle, but it is immensely satisfying not to pay for a car. I always go with the light solution that can still work without being too inconvenient, and I have a higher tolerance than most for inconveniences. It’s a strategy that has been working well so far, and that we hope will work again this year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">As it is the beginning of a new year, we recently renewed our Navigo passes for the whole year.

At the beginning of a new year, I like to think about what I want to have accomplished by the end of the year. I think it’s important to specifically set goals. Otherwise, what happens is that time just passes, and pretty soon another year is gone, and I may look back and wish I had done something differently. Some things may come up naturally and be more easily accomplished, but others require planning a series of smaller steps, or at least specific reminders to get something done on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example would be learning Chinese. I’ll be going for the HSK (Han Shuo Ke) Level 4 Certificate this year, which means that I need to continuously study character meanings, a bit of grammar, and even some writing. This isn’t something that I can put off, and I need to at least register for the test by a certain time of year. I did this in 2019 for HSK Level 3 and had no problems, so if I study a little bit every day, I should be ready for Level 4 this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning a language is just one of the categories in whih I like to plan advancements. There is also my career, which was the main focus of the previous year, and will continue to be an important subject for the foreseeable future. I want to continue to improve my skills as a CTO. I want to keep looking for better ways for our developers to deliver their solutions and corrections to our application. This past year, I have personally grown a lot as a Lead Developer. Now that I have a solid grasp on our application, I want to shift a bit of that focus onto increasing the skills of other developers. This involves things like implementing best practices in the development process, but starts with  just having more discussions to clarify what we are doing and how that is going to further our long-term goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other subjects that I will include, such as improvements to our home, or improving our childrens’ English skills. Most goals have to be conscious decisions that are planned accordingly, otherwise the children will speak English at a decent level, but spelling, reading, and writing will all be delayed. Even though one subject can be the focus for a year, I feel that it is important to have a variety of different types of things that are all addressed. This achieves a sense of balance, and ensures that things don’t get forgotten or left unaddressed the whole year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same vein of thought, I try not to make my goals too big for any one subject. I just want to make small advancements each year, but to make sure that the challenges which I do take on, indeed get done. For example, my plan for our home this year is to finally finish the bedrooms, which basically just need carpetting, and to redo the downstairs bathroom. That is plenty of work by itself. It’s true that I have other plans for our kitchen and eventually the basement, but I’m not going to overwhelm myself thinking about all of that right now. I’m just going to prioritize a couple of important things, and those other improvements can be goals for subsequent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my mind, half the battle is already won by simply recognizing the importance of the process. Once the annual goals have been defined, they are not easily forgotten. Certain things, like reading a book a month, used to be difficult to manage. Now, it is an automatic process that I organize each year. It’s not even really part of my list of goals anymore, because I don’t need to think about it. A new year is a new opportunity for new things to get done, and to feel good for being organized enough to plan out the important challenges which should be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">2020 is finished, and a new year is upon us.

The story of 2020 for us was one of many changes. Of course, COVID-19 was the cause of some of that, but not all. We had never been stagnant in previous years, but had instead tackled big subjects, like the birth of our children or a new house. This year we didn’t have one big challenge like that, but we had a lot of different things come up, some bigger than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started off the year with a new job at a new company. It was a good job, and an opportunity to learn lots of new things, notably Git and ReactJS, as well as NestJS and a few other backend NodeJS frameworks. Despite the new start, I was clear to take a trip with my family to Wuhan during the Winter break in February. COVID-19 crushed that plan. We followed the news closely, and at the time would have probably gone to Wuhan anyway had the airline not cancelled the flight. Over the course of the next few weeks we would find that it was for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, COVID-19 failed to cancel the Rambouillet Half-Marathon, which I completed at the beginning of March. France had put out an order that gatherings of over one thousand people were not allowed just the day before, but that was too late to stop the event, which went on anyway. I knew that I would have pain in my knee, but I finished the event anyway. Pretty soon afterward, the order to stay at home was sent out, and the financial market took a serious hit, effectively ending my new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, an even bigger opportunity immediately filled that gap. I became a CTO / Lead Developer at a small company, and have been quickly gaining experience and increasing my skills ever since.  With all the missed plans, missed school, and work changes that were brought on by the Coronavirus, it was a big relief for us to be able to take a long vacation to Higgins Lake back in the United States during the summer. That was a big break for us, and allowed us to get away from the pressure of quarantines and work for a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at work and back to school, we’ve gotten a lot done since then. Miriam has been working on her spelling, reading, writing, basic addition and even a little subtraction. She has been making so many drawings that I think she must have given one to her teachers each week, and left so many at home that we can’t keep track of them all. Drawing has definitely been her go-to activity this year, and now after receiving her Christmas presents, painting is her new thing. I’ve even gotten her interested in playing LittleBigPlanet on the PlayStation 3. She can do the easiest levels, having overcome her fear of failure on the simplest tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I’ve just finished my reading list for this year. This is a big accomplishment, given that I was lagging behind severely after six months. The books which I read this year were pretty interesting, and I’m proud of myself for selecting and finishing my list of twelve books for the year. I read some pretty big history books as well as some shorter adventure novels. I must have covered at least six books in the last three months of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My saintly wife has made having the holidays at home a treat. Though Halloween was pretty much cancelled because of the pandemic, we had wonderful meals at home for both Thanksgiving and Christmas. Our little family of four had a great time together celebrating the holidays. For me, this is a good sign that though the pandemic may not be over quickly, and in fact even when it is over all may not go back to normal, we always have each other. We don’t just stick it out together, we have fun together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 was obviously the year of the Coronavirus, but that was just the foundation of many of the challenges that we faced and conquered. The next year will bring more challenges, and we look forward to tackling those too. Missing out on school, work, and seeing our family is not fun in and of itself, but those situations make us stronger. This is good, because I’m convinced that though we may have seen the worst of the Coronavirus, the pandemic itself is not the biggest problem we face, and the next year may prove to be just as challenging, if not more, than this past year has been.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">Compared to most people, we have weathered 2020 quite well.

The one I think of in November is that there is no Thanksgiving holiday to provide a buffer between Halloween and Christmas. Though the French don’t typically start singing their Christmas carols in early November, they also don’t have any reason to wait until December to put up their Christmas decorations and encourage the holiday shopping season to start. So for us, the Christmas season has been building up for a while. But now, with just a few more days until Christmas Day, it really does feel like Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are doing a smaller Christmas at home this year, just the four of us, my wife pointed out the importance of making Christmas special. I’m very happy that she wants to make this Christmas special, as Christmas is not really a big celebration back in China, so I wasn’t raelly expecting her to go all out. But she pointed out that it is important for our children to have good memories of Christmas, and for us to make Christmas special with some traditions just for us. I think that she also wants to make Christmas an enjoyable time for me, and has already proposed a big turkey dinner, with lots of stuff to eat on the side. Though I will probably need to prepare my holidays sweatpants for the aftermath, I am grateful to have a wife who is willing to put a lot of effort into making this holiday special for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have contributed a bit as well by bringing a Christmas tree back from our local grocery store parking lot. This is not as small a thing as it may seem since I had to bring it back on the bicycle trailer. The trees become available at the beginning of December, and though I try to wait awhile before getting ours, I’m always concerned about being left with few good options, as there is a limited selection and some are much more expensive than others. So I got the tree almost three weeks before Christmas, and it has been shedding pine needles in the corner of our living room ever since. Well, ever since I cut the top foot off of it, because I can never remember how tall our living room ceiling is when I’m buying Christmas trees, and I figure that bigger is better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And underneath our tree, the presents have been steadily multiplying. It seems that every year, I think that we’ll just have a few gifts to give out and that will be fine. After all, our children are young and we don’t need a lot of gifts to enjoy the holidays. And every year, a few gifts quickly turns into enough to fill up all the space underneath the tree. We start out with a few things that we picked up, usually toys for the kids. Pretty soon, we start getting packages in the mail every other day, and if the gifts aren’t labeled, we have a hard time keeping track of which is from whom, as we have so many. We’re blessed to have family that takes the extra effort to send gifts from overseas. That takes more time and planning, and is more of an expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t got a concrete plan for starting a big events, but the great thing is that we are all together for the next week. School is out for two full weeks, and I’m off work for one full week. That leaves us plenty of time to hang out together and enjoy the season. We may not have a White Christmas, but on most days we have a wonderful fire going in our fireplace. My wife spent a little extra to put some basic ornaments on the tree, and of course our daughter Miriam never gets tired of making drawings to decorate the tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great traditions are often just activities that come naturally, like playing games in the house with the kids. The big planned outings and events are fun too, but they kind of are expected to be. The memories that I enjoy the most are the unexpected joys of laughing and spending time with family members, often doing nothing more than talking. Those are the types of memories that we will hopefully be making as we spend time together this Christmas, just the four of us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">France and America have some big differences when it comes to the Christmas season. The one I think of in November is that there is no Thanksgiving holiday to provide a buffer between Halloween and Christmas. Though the French don’t typically start singing their Christmas carols in early November, they also don’t have any reason to wait until December to put up their Christmas decorations and encourage the holiday shopping season to start. So for us, the Christmas season has been building up for a while. But now, with just a few more days until Christmas Day, it really does feel like Christmas.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Frostpunk</title><link href="/blog/2020/12/frostpunk.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Frostpunk" /><published>2020-12-13T09:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-12-13T09:00:00+01:00</updated><id>/blog/2020/12/frostpunk</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2020/12/frostpunk.html">&lt;p&gt;I’m a little hesitant to spend time talking about a video game, but I think that given how much time I have spent playing this game recently, and the amount of time I have spent thinking about the game, it is only right that I dedicate a post to the game. The game of which I am speaking is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frostpunkgame.com/&quot;&gt;Frostpunk&lt;/a&gt;, a strategy game released in 2018 by developer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11bitstudios.com/&quot;&gt;11-bit studios&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frostpunk is a strategy game and a city-building game. There are already many games in this genre, and I have played some very good city-building games over the years. What drew me to this game was that it is a very different style than most city-building games. In fact, in some ways it could be classified as a survival game. In Frostpunk, the player must build a city which can survive in a frozen wasteland which becomes gradually colder over time.  As the temperature falls, the citizens of the city need to continue to stay warm at home and at work, in addition to being able to eat. In order to make that happen, resources needed to be gathered, research must be done, buildings must be built, and choices must be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have really been enjoying this game, but that is not a surprise since I enjoy most strategy games. Strategy games give me the ability to be in control of something with a global view of the situation, instead of simply controlling one character. These games also don’t typically require expensive gaming computers, which is convenient. What’s fun about strategy games for me is being the one in charge, and making every decision. In such a position, I can put my own personal touch on new buildings and the city. I can organize the city in the way that I like. For example, in a typical city-building game, I can create a nice grid layout which satisfies me, organized by type of building. Oddly enough, organizing things is a big part of the fun for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frostpunk is different. First of all, it is set during the the late nineteenth century, in a fictional setting in which extreme climate events have entered the Earth into a period of extreme cold. There are no modern technologies, and the city-building doesn’t involve setting up a university or subway system. Next, the city is organized around a generator, in a circular shape, instead of the typical grid. That alone is a big change. Streets still need to be created, but they are simple wooden walkways. Like many strategy games, resources need to be collected, but in this scenario coal must be collected for heat, wood and steel for construction and research, and finally food to keep people alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frostpunk also mixes in exploration, by demanding the player to organize scouts to go out beyond the city and find resources or other survivors and even cities. These become a big part of the strategy as well as the story as scouts discover what is happening outside the city. Ultimately the main differene between Frostpunk and a normal city-building game is that it uses the increasing cold as the factor which drives the story and game forward. The temperature must decrease in order to continually challenge the player to keep all citizens alive and in good health, while also advancing on other frontiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, strategy games like Frostpunk aren’t just an enjoyable way to spend time. At its most basic level, the game is a game of resource management. The player starts out with nothing but some people, and based on how the player uses their citizens’ time, the player either succeeds or fails. The order in which things are done is very important. Often, a short-term goal must be reached in order to survive, but long-term goals must also be balanced in order to be prepared for future challenges, such as a further drop in temperature, or a need for an increase in the production of a certain resource, or the need for a certain advanced type of research to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the same type of thinking which we employ in real life. We have short term goals, but we also have long term plans, and we have to keep those in mind as well. Based on what I’ve learned from games such as Frostpunk, I usally prioritize long-term plans, and I rarely go for the easier option which requires less effort or resources. At work, it’s important to immediately realize a new feature or fix a bug immediately, but I also highly value moving towards long-term goals such as fixes the global architecture of the application, or implementing some best practice. Achieving the long-term goals makes the short-term issues easier to resolve. Ideally all short-term goals would fit into the long-term picture, but sometimes in life, as in Frostpunk, that isn’t the case.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">I’m a little hesitant to spend time talking about a video game, but I think that given how much time I have spent playing this game recently, and the amount of time I have spent thinking about the game, it is only right that I dedicate a post to the game.

Jomboy has a fantastic channel, with many videos of just a few minutes, called “breakdowns”. Each one focuses on a single part of a game, usually a baseball game, and makes it entertaining. That in itself is a huge achievement considering that I am not a big of fan baseball, would never watch a full baseball game, and would not of my own volition seek to understand all the nuances of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is interesting to me is that this channel has actually made me more interested in baseball than I was before, which, as stated, is no small feat. No major sports media outlet has ever interested me in how a pitcher may be tipping his pitches, or how players on different baseball teams react to one another. What sets Jomboy Media apart is that it brings me as the viewer into the baseball world and makes it more personal and human. The main way this is done is through very good lip-reading and second-by-second narration of what the players in the video are saying and thinking. Did I mention that it is done in a very humorous way? The point of the video is to entertain, but in doing so, some videos inevitable educate the viewer on the mentality of the players, the unknown rules of the game, and the minute details that I would never have picked up on if I were watching a typicall broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Jomboy doesn’t just cover baseball. The most popular video to date is a commentary on the 2012 Inuit Ear Pulling championship. If it sounds silly, just watch the video while listening to Jomboy (Jimmy O’Brien) do the commentary. Between that, Finnish Baseball, Teqball, and many other unusual sports, there is a lot of good material for Jomboy’s entertaining commentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the channel isn’t just cheap entertainment. Jomboy was actually on the leading edge of the cheating scandal from the Houston Astros 2017 season. Just hours after The Athletic posted details of the subject for the first time, Jomboy Media had a video up breaking down exactly how the Astros were making noise in the dugout to signal certain pitches to the batter, and that the information gained at that speed could never have been done without using a camera. The breakdown format is hilarious when dubbing over a player’s thoughts in an already-entertaining situation, and it is also informative for investigating details. It’s clearly a format that is working well for Jomboy, and one that shows how online sports content is very much different than traditional cable television sports coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online, as a viewer I am much faster to change pages or videos, meaning that the videos of just a few minutes are perfect. I don’t really need a former player or experienced television presenter to narrate everything to me. Certainly, inside knowledge of the sport is needed for the more in-depth breakdowns, which is where Jomboy shows that he knows his stuff. I don’t want to wait until the end of the season for a well-compiled Top 10 list. I might just be interested to see something unusual that happened yesterday for a minute or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I think that it’s better to get the information from an intelligent sports fan that to get it from a sports celebrity. When watching Jomboy, it feels like a friend is sharing something funny and interesting with me, and I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about the narrator. By comparison, I think too many of the modern commentators and personaltiies found on television seem to be injecting themselves as a type of character into the story. They do this with funny voices or fake outrage, but I would prefer to just be entertained by the sports rather than a sideshow. Jomboy’s entertainment comes directly from the baseball action itself, which (again), is quite impressive considering just how unentertaining I normally find baseball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my interest in Jomboy’s channel and my continual visits to see what new breakdowns have been published shows an alternative to traditional television sports journalism. Whether or not that ends up being ultimately beneficial for sports business or players, or even viewers, remains to be seen. At the very least, I can affirm that Jomboy’s channel is highly entertaining, and has shed new light on baseball for me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">Sometime during the baseball season I stumbled upon a YouTube channel called Jomboy Media.

I feel confident in saying that we were the only participants in Thanksgiving festivities in our neighborhood, since I am the only American. We’ve done this for a couple of years, and were lucky enough to share Thanksgiving with another American family two years ago. The nature of life abroad is that holidays happen differently. And while for many aspects of living abroad, there are tricks we can use or different ways of seeing things, when it comes to holidays I find that there is no secret way to make an American holiday feel like it would back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in America, on Thanksgiving Day I would be with my immediate family, eating a ridiculously large meal. Afterwards we would hobble to the couch and watch some Thanksgiving Day football. Probably wearing sweatpants to accept my new rotund shape after Thanksgiving dinner, I would be enjoying a day or two in the holiday routine before heading back to work or school. It’s a privilege to have a place to go for Thanksgiving, and though at the time it can feel like a bit of a hassle to travel at the busiest time of the year, it definitely feels good to be back home for the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, our home is in France now, and it’s not very convenient to fly back to the United States for a few days. So we do a little Thanksgiving meal at our house. This year, my wife cooked a big chicken quite well, substituting lime for lemon in a recipe that I have come to really enjoy. I must have eaten it four or five times this year, and it has always been great. This time was no exception, and it was enjoyable to have something special for the occasion. I also put on Charlie Brown for the children, as I think it’s fun to have a little tradition for the children, and I like Charlie Brown too. But other than those things, we didn’t have much of a Thanksgiving. I went to work, Miriam went to school, and life went on as it would on any other weekday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily I’m pretty much okay with that, but it definitely is one of the downsides of living abroad. You simply can’t have a full American Thanksgiving experience abroad. If we want to celebrate our own holidays, we have to make our own atmosphere. It’s something that we are working on, as we want our children to experience these things, and to have good memories of holidays like Thanksgiving. We want our children to know the meaning of the holidays that we grew up celebrating, as well as those new ones we celebrate alongside the French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while having American holidays abroad is different, there is also a difference in the way that we experience French holidays. We didn’t grow up in France, so we don’t have childhood memories of celebrating important French holidays in a uniquely French way. When I’m off of work for a French holiday, often it’s just a simple day off of work for me. If the holiday is for a war memorial, then I might try and watch something related to the subject to think about the sacrifice or suffering related to the holdiay, but for many other holidays, I can’t have the same connection as someone who grew up here. In my defense, I’m not sure that all French people are fervently celebrating the Catholic holidays, such as Ascension or Assomption, so there may not be much for us to do for some of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in France has been a wonderful experience for us, as we get to present others with something they don’t usually see, and learn from them at the same time. Unfortunately we can’t simply take all of the good and none of the bad. We don’t get to spend every holidays with our families. My longsuffering wife is especially aware of this, as recent events have made travel back to China difficult for us, and even in the best of times Chinese New Year does not align perfectly with the French school calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We simply do the best we can, and are grateful for those times that we are back in the USA or China with our families, just like days of our childhoods. In the meantime, we try to get into the local French holidays and try new things. We may not have a lot of experience with Bastille Day, but we can celebrate anyway. We can also try some new things at Christmas, mixing what we already love with something new. In the process, perhaps we can share a little Thanksgiving in France.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">This week we celebrated Thanksgiving at our house.

Well, really my wife and children speak three. I’m still working on my Chinese, and it’s usually on hold because of other priorities. But as I speak English natively, and my wife is a native Chinese speaker, our children grow up understanding and communicating in both of those languages. And of course, as we live in France, we use French at work, school, church, with our friends, and everywhere we have to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chose French deliberately. When I met my wife, she was doing a Master’s program in Linguistics, specifically English and French. The obvious reason that she was studying these two languages is that they are global languages, spoken by a significant portion of the Earth’s population, and certainly hold political significance as well. That was the same basic reason that I was interested in Chinese and French as an American. Obviously one of these turned out to be a bit harder for me to learn than the other, but the fact remains that both are powerful languages. Our goals are simply to expand our horizons and experience different things. French opens up a lot more opportunities for us than other languages which have fewer speakers concentrated in weaker countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of good reasons for us to live in France: as a third country it’s “neutral” ground for our family, it could allow for citizenship opportunities with significant benefits in Europe, and it offers a new language for us and our children. More significantly, this new language offers new ways of thinking. The pattern of langauge and the way we use it affects the way we think and behave, to some extent. A simple example is the formal “vous”, as opposed to the informal “tu”. This separation, common in many languages, differs from the ambiguous English “you”. The effect that I see is that a French person behaves more distant from somebody that they don’t know, whereas an English speaker, especially an American, is usually comfortable making small talk with complete strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immersion is the best way to learn a new language. Though it involves a lot of sacrifice to move somewhere new where you aren’t yet comfortable with the local language, there is a lot of value in seeing native speakers in their natural habitat. Language goes hand and hand with behavior and lifestyle. We can learn grammar in a classroom in a foreign country, but it makes more sense when we see people speaking, whispering, arguing, even sending emails and text messages in the language. At that point the practical use of the language becomes apparent, which drives the will to learn. After being immersed for a while, the culture and the language become enjoyable in some way. For example, I personally am not very outgoing, and don’t really look forward to making small talk with employees at a store, or other people in a places where I’m basically just looking to get something done and leave. French is good for that, because we stay at the formal level. We say “Bonjour” or “Bonsoir” and that little communication suffices. Back in the USA “Hi” often just leads into a comment about what I’m buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every language has its pros and cons, but some appear more advantageous than others. Just the economic opportunities offered by English make it the most desirable language to know in my mind. A language like French offers a different way of thinking, not influenced too much by English (though that may be changing), an alternative in the modern Western world. To me, Chinese (Mandarin) shows how over time a language can become less practical. In the modern world, we are looking to become more flexible, and more able to quickly adapt to a changing environment. Mandarin grammar and Chinese characters, even Simplified Chinese characters, don’t exhibit that characteristic. When a new technology comes along, we have to construct a term from existing characters. A computer is “电脑”, literally “electric brain”. And while certainly it is practical to spend less on neon lighting for the sign reading “电脑” instead of “computer”, in the age of (ironically) computers, that advantage isn’t very impressive. We aren’t carving our writing into stone, or writing on precious scrolls. Often we aren’t even printing out our language at all, meaning that the savings on length is negligible. Instead, we have to memorize thousands of characters to have a good grasp of the language, and we have much less ability to deduce the meaning of a term compared to another language, where we derive words from other words. Our behavior becomes more focused on memorization than reasoning or creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever language we choose to learn, we should do so knowing it will open our eyes to different ways of communicating, not just in grammar but in behavior as well. If we can recognize that and accept that the ways we knew before might not always be the best ways, that is half the battle to growing as a person. A person who understand multiple languages is one who normally has more ways of thinking, more ways of solving or avoiding problems, of being creative, and of achieving their goals.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">It’s inevitable that when people get to know us, pretty early on in the conversation, they find out that we speak three different languages.

I feel that from that point on, the thru-hike became a point of reference for the way that I see the different challenges that I take on, and an analogy in many ways. When I began to examine the ways in which thru-hikers take on a challenging trail, or how people take on different kinds of challenges, I identified the very first phase of the challenge as the most important determining factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important challenges that I see in my life are not short affairs, but rather efforts which take a long time to accomplish. Like marathons, they require endurance and planning. Raising children, paying off a mortgage, and managing a career are all examples of big tasks which take years to tackle. As such, they are more like marathons than sprints. Treating them like sprints often leads to burning out too quickly. My theory is that the beginning of all of these things is the most important, just as was the case for my hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started my hike, I made mistakes. I misplaced my tarp and had to order a new one. I walked out of Key West without any food and had to subsist on Gatorage for a day. My feet began to hurt, I got a couple of blisters, and then the Big Cypress National Preserve ripped those off as I waded through its swamplands for two days. After two weeks of hardship, I soaked my feet in Epsom salt and they became as hard as rock. I had stealth-camped in the woods in the Florida Keys, waded past the Alligators in the Everglades, and there was much less to be concerned about from that point on. Those two weeks were the trial period that formed the foundation of my hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, I should have done a better job at taking care of myself. I shouldn’t have lost my tarp, and I should have left Key West with some food. The thing working in my favor was that hiking through the Florida Keys was quite forgiving. It was beautiful, it was flat, and the weather was great. Sure, the Seven Mile Bridge was a hardship, as was the hike out of the Keys up to Florida City and the subsequent hike through Big Cypress National Preserve, but ultimately the flat terrain and good weather were a big help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to give tips for thru-hikers on the Appalachian Trail, I would have to suggest starting the hike somewhere easier than Northern Georgia. Why not do the Pinhoti Trail in Alabama and Georgia, covering the smaller Southern Appalachians and leading into the more daunting Appalachian Trail? Starting the Appalachian Trail in Northern Georgia is like starting a marathon at the bottom of a big hill. Ultimately, it shouldn’t matter, as Northern Georgia is but a small portion of the trail, but it requires good planning and good discipline to stick with it through the ups and downs of the steep trail through the starting portion of the trail. The high dropout numbers on the Appalachian Trail might be less if those people were able to test their legs on the smaller hills in Alabama first. It’s bad enough finding out that your pack is too heavy, but it can end your hike to find that out when you are staring at a day full of big climbs straight up big mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m interested in Source-to-Sea descents of rivers, which follow the same pattern. The beginning of the river is the portion with small creeks which can only be navigated with something small like a packraft. There are rapids, more turns, and faster water. This faster water then becomes slower as the river widens. At a certain point, the journey is a simple endurance test to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the same pattern prevails in life. I consider one of the most important parts of my career to be making a good first impression and learning the ropes at any new job. I always want to soak up as much as I can in those first days and weeks to make everything go smoother later on. The well-known statement from the Book of Proverbs states “Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it.” This acknowledges that the formation of a person’s character happens in childhood. The turbulent waters of difficult questions and worldviews are encountered in those years, and the way that a person rides those rapids determines what sort of path they will be on later in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a father, my goal is to not start a marathon on an uphill. We’ll tackle all those difficult things, but we’ll do so in an environment where mistakes aren’t fatal. I don’t try to start a new job by changing the fundamental way in which a company operates without a good understanding of the internal functions of the company. I have started my career by working hard to do things the right way despite the extra work that may entail in the short term, in the hope that this will pave the way for future success. As a hiker, I ensure success before the hike has even begun with good planning that diminishes the impact of mistakes I make out on the trail. I set the pace for the marathon on flat ground when I can, in order to be prepared for the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">After finishing my thru-hike of the Eastern Continental Trail in 2012, I used that accomplishment as a springboard to take on other challenges. I feel that from that point on, the thru-hike became a point of reference for the way that I see the different challenges that I take on, and an analogy in many ways. When I began to examine the ways in which thru-hikers take on a challenging trail, or how people take on different kinds of challenges, I identified the very first phase of the challenge as the most important determining factor.</summary></entry></feed>
