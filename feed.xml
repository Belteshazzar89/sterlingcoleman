We were originally scheduled to visit in February 2020, but needless to say COVID ruined those plans. This time, our trip has coincided perfectly with my wife’s sister’s wedding, so we have been doing that for the past few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese wedding is not a simple affair, even by modern Western standards of expensive and overcomplicated weddings. The amount of preparation that goes into the event is enormous. Months in advance, both families organize events together and separately. There are outfits, haircuts, house decorations, car decorations, copious amounts of fireworks, and of course, lots of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t do very much myself in terms of preparation, I simply helped put up some decorations around the house, and some other small things. My wife did more, but as we arrived just a week before the wedding day, we only did a little compared to my wife’s parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first day of the multi-day affair, my wife and her parents got up at 5:00 in the morning and went to a restaurant near their house to start preparations for the wedding meal. I wasn’t quite so helpful, but I was there at 9 in the morning after spending an hour learning how to tie a bow-tie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wore the same outfit that I wore to my brother’s wedding a couple of years ago, a shirt, bow-tie, and vest with pants to match. I was a tad overdressed compared to many people, who showed up in T-shirts, shorts, and sandals. My main job on the wedding day was to offer a special wedding cigarette to each wedding guest as they arrived. Needless to say, I was not too heartbroken when many people kindly refused my offer. Of over a hundred guests, I think I gave out ten cigarettes in two hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kitchen was not big enough to serve everyone, so we waited for a long time to eat after the first half of guests had finished their meal. I tried lots of food not typically found back home, such as eel and turtle. As with all important meals, all the men had to drink alcohol, and I was no exception. Chinese alcohol is basically gasoline as far as I can tell, but I survived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In China, a wedding is a bit more than a marriage of two people. Many Chinese people will tell you that a marriage is a joining of two families. The second day was my wife’s sister’s husband’s family’s turn to host, and there was a lot of ceremony to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the morning, the groom and many men from his family showed up to the hosue to make a big racket and coax his bride to come with him. I believe the idea behind this pretend play is that the woman should want to stay with her parents, and only come with the groom after much heckling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we all got in cars and drove to the groom’s parents’ house. But we couldn’t drive straight there, as that would be return path for them, and taking such a path would symbolize reversing cours on the marriage, since it would be a direct reversal of the course on the road. Therefore we took a roundabout way which took longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After visiting briefly at the house for photos (did I mention that the bride and groom are wearing specialy red outfits, and that the bride had to be carried from her house to the car, then to the groom’s parents house? Her feet of course cannot touch the ground in between the two), we made it to the restaurant, where there were not enough seats for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We watched a nice little wedding ceremony which symbolized the joining of the two families. It was not a religious ceremony at all, but rather hosted by a Master of Ceremonies who then did some karaoke at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, rest, and then dinner there, the wedding was done for me, though I believe that there were more things to do for the newlywed couple. In any case, I was more than ready to not eat anything and most importantly not drink anything for a day or two afterwards. I was pretty close to being sick on the second day, but I made it through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall it was interesting, but I’m glad that I didn’t have a Chinese wedding when I got married, and I’m also glad that my wife only has one sibling. This was hopefully my first and last full Chinese wedding.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">This summer, we are finally getting a chance to see my wife’s family in China.

I didn’t really play with other children very regularly or make a friend until I went to kindergarten. In my first year of school, I made a couple friends. My first friend was Jonathan. Like many boys, we shared an interest in running fast and playing games, and that was enough to form a solid friendship. While my parents were at to the hospital for several days for my brother’s birth, I was doing my first sleepover at Jonathan’s house. Those first few years of school, we played so many games together. I remember playing with Legos in Jonathan’s room. I remember eating pizza by the pool as we celebrated Jonathan’s birthday. I remember running around his house playing with a home laser tag kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we had fun playing, there emerged quickly signs that I can look back on now and see that Jonathan was different than many of the other kids that we played with. Something about his mental state was different. He always had a fierce attitude, and while he always defended his friends to all extremes, that same energy would sometimes manifest itself in small acts of violence. Hitting girls, even a teacher, was a recurring disciplinary issue from what I remember. Eventually, Jonathan left our elementary school and I didn’t hear from him for a couple years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In seventh grade, I was transitioning to a young adult and I was not at the top of the social hierarchy, though I had a good group of friends. One day, Jonathan showed up at our school, visiting for a day in order to prepare to return the next year. The change in him was astounding. Gone was the athletic and fiesty boy who frequently got into trouble. Jonathan wore suits and ties, and had his hair heavily gelled back. I was mortified to be the object of ridicule as he tagged along with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He came back to our school the next year and wore those suits and ties for several years. I was one of his few friends, but I was still embarassed to hang out with him at school. It was clear that a transition had occurred from elementary to middle school and in some sense Jonathan was on a different path. We were discovering new social situations, popularity, girls, and puberty. He was wearing suits and ties, greasing his hair back, and reading history books. He didn’t do anything athletic, the school allowed him to consider walking his dog as his sports credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In high school, video games was what we had in common. Jonathan’s approach to growing up was to acquire new things. When he discovered something new, he bought it. He had an enormous TV with a nice sound system. He had many, many Xbox games, many hard rock CDs, and a big DVD collection. As a teenager you would never have as much stuff at your disposal as when you were hanging out with Jonathan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing remained constant about the Jonathan that I knew from kindergarten: if you were his friend, he would do anything for you. I had a LAN party when Halo 2 came out and Jonathan brought two televisions over to my house, including his gigantic flatscreen. I didn’t need to ask him for things, he wanted to share his latest interests with me. DVDs and Xbox games were loaned, and when I got my own Xbox, he gave me an old TV so that we could play together. Jonathan was indeed a person who made extreme choices, and nothing was more extreme than his willingness to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, as high school progressed, some people took advantage of Jonathan’s kindness to ask him for favors under the pretense of false friendship. With his desire to be accepted, he got involved with whatever was proposed to him, namely marijuana. He ended up crashing his BMW while under the influence and severely injured himself, requiring metal plates and screws in his legs, and was out of school for months. Nearing the end of school, his grades were poor and he didn’t get accepted to many universities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our high school friend groups separated to go to different colleges, Jonathan didn’t complete orientation at his new school before he was arrested on a drunk driving charge and kicked out of school before it had even begun. We didn’t have much contact as I was off at university. I believe he eventually joined another university, but after I graduated I saw in the news that he had been arrested for various mischief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been 16 years since we graduated high school together. That wasn’t the end of Jonathan’s story, but it was the end of our time together. Over the years I occasionally scanned social media and the internet to see how he was doing, but there was no trace. I hoped that someday we would have a class reunion and that I could shake his hand. Perhaps he would be a completely different person than the teenager led astray that I last knew. That reunion never happened. Recently I received news that Jonathan had just ended his own life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that I am sad does not adequately describe my feelings. Jonathan was my first friend. It pained me to see him different than his peers, and it pains me to think about our time together and wonder if I was a good friend to him. I wish that we had remained in contact. I can’t imagine his feelings, seeing that his path was different than so many of his classmates and peers, and dealing with that into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to cry but I can’t. It seems like I shouldn’t feel much of anything since I have not heard from Jonathan in so many years, but the fact remains he was my first friend, and one of a very few people who I have known throughout my school years. I shouldn’t feel guilty since we have been out of contact so long. And yet, I believe few people have known Jonathan as long or as well as I. It makes me sick to think that he spent his last moments alone. It was a privilege to have gotten to know him, despite his flaws, but I wish there were more good times to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">When I was little, my parents didn’t send me to pre-school regularly.

One of those things is attending to the hedges that separate us from our neighbors. I had taken care of own side of our property a couple of months ago, and had thought that I would do the next side the following weekend. Two months later, I finally got the courage on a Saturday morning to get up early and do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are lucky to have wonderful neighbors who are happy to share a few tools with us. One of those things that we don’t own is a hedge trimmer. Not only did our neighbor lend me his hedge trimmer, but he also lent me a platform on which to stand to trim the top of the hedge. It took me several conversations with him to learn how to start the troublesome gas-powered hedge trimmer. Even with the trimmer on and the choke valve open, the trimmer would start upon pulling the cord, then stop immediately. This sort of experience is one of the more frustrating parts of house projects, as it requires a process to learn how to use troublesome tools that won’t be necessary for another year. Finally I found that I could pull the cord with the choke closed, let the trimmer idle for a bit, then open the choke halfway and rev the engine a few times. After that I could fully open the choke and get to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work itself is very tough. The trimmer is heavy and chopping through the tops of thick hedges is hard work. After a few minutes of that, my forearms were shot and I spent some time collecting and disposing of the hedge trimmings as a way to rest my arms. It has been a few years since I trimmed the hedges, so there was a lot to do, and in total I filled up more than half of the big organic disposal container dedicated to our neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only did I do my side of the hedge, but I also did my neighbor’s side as technically the hedge is entirely on our property. That effectively doubled my work, as I can only reach half of the hedge from each side, as it is wide. My neighbor is elderly and so I appreciated him moving a few things so that I could access the hedge from his side, but I didn’t ask him to help with the collection of branches or the painful trimming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started working before 10 in the morning, and didn’t finish until almost 4 in the afternoon. One day later, my arms are covered in scrapes, but thankfully the rashes are mostly gone. There is a reason that I haven’t trimmed the hedges in a few years, and I’m not sure I’ll have the courages to do it all again next year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">With the arrival of Spring my mood has picked up considerably, and I have the energy to do a lot of things that I have been putting off for a long time.

As I continue to think about the subject, one of the things which comes to the forefront of my mind is the Alabama Roadwalk, which sticks out as the only portion of the ECT between Key West and Québec where a thru-hiker is continuously on paved roads for almost 200 miles. While pondering this, my curiosity got the better of me when I had the question “How much of the Alamaba roadwalk could be done on dirt roads?”. This Google Earth &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/resources/exploration/eastern-continental-trail/ar-dirt-alternative.kmz&quot;&gt;file&lt;/a&gt; is the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two main appeals of dirt roads for hikers is that the dirt is softer than a paved road and therefore causes fewer problems for the feet, and there are fewer people in the area in general, meaning fewer cars passing by. The areas that dirt roads travel through are of course more remote as well, which is often a desirable aspect for thru-hikers. That being said, this same remoteness comes with the disadvantage that there are very few services in the area. Most importantly, issues like uncontrolled dogs and suspicious homeowners would be more of a problem in remote areas where people are not used to seeing thru-hikers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mapping out a dirt roadwalk took considerable time, as I needed to have a global sense of which regions of Alabama had plenty of dirt roads going North-South. I also had to backtrack several times as I found myself mapping a section that led into an area with no dirt roads at all. My goal was to put the roadwalk on dirt roads as much as possible, while still keeping it generally in line with the route between the Florida and Pinhoti trails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a 50 mile increase over the original 200 mile roadwalk, as dirt roads are much less direct. In total, I would estimate that about 200 of these miles are on dirt roads. Certain portions of the state have no dirt roads, and as Montgomery and the Alabama River form a big obstacle that must be bypassed on either the East or West. My choice was to head West and go through Selma, then come back East across the Coosa River and take the path on the Coosa Trail as the current Alabama Roadwalk does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its winding path, the Dirt Roadwalk avoids any cities or towns, with the exception of Selma, which must be traversed to cross the Alabama River to the West of Montgomery. It specifically goes through sparsely-populated areas and rarely passes by a store of any kind. It would make for an intesting walk in theory, though in practice it’s unclear how encounters in the deep backcountry of Alabama would play out for a thru-hiker.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">Lately, I’ve been doing a lot of work on the website that I’ve created for the Eastern Continental Trail.

We know in advance when it will be there, as we receive a notice in the mail that the roads will be closed the weekend of the Fête du Muguet. That doesn’t typically affect us, though the bus won’be running during those times either. The carnival is a nice time to walk around the town and look at the attractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, with children those attractions become very tempting and are constantly the subject of much begging and demanding. We set a budget this year of 20 euros to spend at the carnival, but that isn’t much to spend on two children, with many things costing more than 5 euros a person. The attractions consist of pellet shooting games to win prizes, some being easier and for smaller reward, others being impossible with the hope of winning a PlayStation 5 or some other very expensive prize. There are bumper cars, rides that spin, rides that flip, and rides that go around in endless circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our children, the attraction that is still the winner is the multi-story labyrinth. It’s perfect for us as parents as well, as we can send the kids in, and they can spend as much time as they want playing inside. When they come out, they can’t go back in, so we tell them not to come out until we call them. This year, the kids spent a full hour playing inside, and were still sad when we called them out. That was money well spent (6 euros a person).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, we went to the part of the carnival with the bigger, more sickening rides. Swinging ships, scrambled eggs, and the sort of thing that I would really prefer not to ride at a temporary carnival. This year, however, my wife offered me 20 euros to ride a horrible looking thing which requires a serious locking shoulder harness for riders in order to then spin them while doing the classic Swinging Ship action. We paid the 8 euros for my ticket, and our friend Léo got a ticket as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, we strapped in and were raised up above the town, with 10 other people. I then almost got sick as we spent several minutes spinning upside down. At the points when we went completely upside-down, we stayed like that for several seconds, and the only thing keeping us from falling fifty meters to our deaths was the shoulder harness. I was legitimately scared and started to get a little sick. I held onto a pair of metal handles on the seats for dear life in case the shoulder harness failed, though I’m not sure I would have been able to keep myself from falling if that had happened. I was happy to be off the ride after a few more minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that done, we had to endure a lot of crying and whining about all the things we didn’t do. To be honest, I kind of hate doing these carnivals with our kids for just that reason. Everything is expensive, there is no bracelet to buy to be able to do everything as much as we want, and small children can’t ever be happy with what they have done if they see something else they want. We walked home and I lay down to recover from another Fête du Muguet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">Last weekend the Fête du Muguet returned to Rambouillet, as it does every year. We know in advance when it will be there, as we receive a notice in the mail that the roads will be closed the weekend of the Fête du Muguet. That doesn’t typically affect us, though the bus won’be running during those times either. The carnival is a nice time to walk around the town and look at the attractions.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Flea Market Season</title><link href="/blog/2023/05/flea-market-season.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Flea Market Season" /><published>2023-05-08T12:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2023-05-08T12:00:00+02:00</updated><id>/blog/2023/05/flea-market-season</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2023/05/flea-market-season.html">&lt;p&gt;With the very beginning of Spring a month or two ago, I have once again been frequenting the local &lt;em&gt;vide-greniers&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;brocantes&lt;/em&gt;. These are the French terms for the flea markets which pop up all over the place starting in the Spring. In the past, we would go to more of these when our children were very small, as they are perfect for finding secondhand baby clothes, and babies change sizes very quickly. Before this year, I had not been to a flea market since before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I have been consciously going to a lot of these. It takes a little discipline to set reminders and to get up early on Sunday mornings to be out at the event by eight in the morning, But it is necessary if we want to get the things we are looking for, as the best stuff goes quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each village tends to have a flea market once a year, and larger towns have several. Most districts in Paris have a flea market every weekend, it seems. I’ve found that it is best to visit the small villages, where people have saved up things all year and are willing to sell for low prices to get rid of their stuff. So far, I’ve been out to Le Perray and Cernay, and today I went to Vielle Église.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was most surprised today, as I expected the flea market at Vielle-Église-des-Yvelines to be small, as the village itself is home to about 600 people. I think the close proximity to Rambouillet changed a lot of things, as when I arrived I had a little difficulty maneuvering my bicycle through the swarm of cars to park it close to the entrance to the flea market. The market itself was the main street of the village, closed off to cars and lined with tables of goods for several hundred meters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These flea markets are still great opportunities to find cheap clothing for our kids. Some tables have their clothing well organized in labeled bins so that it is easy to walk up and find the exact size you are looking for. Today I got at least 10 pieces of clothing for each of our children, plus two pairs of shoes for Miriam and one pair for Daniel. I spent about 30 euros for all of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found that the key is to be quick and find the tables which have a lot of children’s clothing, especially if it is labeled with the age range you are looking for. Obviously I buy a size or two bigger than what our children are wearing right now. Then I ask what the price generally is, and usually the answer is about one euro per item. Occasionally I will buy some things at two euros a piece. The best thing to find is shoes. Good shoes for kids are a real steal, and today I really lucked out as I bought a pair of tennis shoes in good condition and a pair of Velcro strap sandals for one euro each. For another pair of shoes I paid three euros, which is still a good deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m planning on continuing to frequent these flea markets as much as I can this year. Even if not every item is a big hit with our kids, I’ve found that few of the things I buy turn out to be duds. It’s fun to feel like you’re getting a good deal, and for kids’ clothing, it’s a really good way to save money. The added bonus for me is that I get to visit a lot of cool little villages and see them bustling on an early Saturday or Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">With the very beginning of Spring a month or two ago, I have once again been frequenting the local vide-greniers, or brocantes.

When I first got interested in the French football pyramid and the lower leagues, I looked up which team at a decent level was closest to Rambouillet. It took some searching, but I found FC Versailles playing in the National 3, the fifth division of French football, which consists of ten groups of fourteen teams, with only the top team in each group being promoted to the next level up. Versailles were playing very well at that level, and were in first place, though US Ivry was hot on their heels. That season was cut short by COVID, and the French Football Federation made the decision to allow promotion and relegation to continue, despite only about two thirds of the season having been played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that bit of luck, Versailles moved up from the National 3 to the National 2, which consists of four groups of sixteen team, again with only one team from each group being promoted. The following season did not start exceptionally well for Versailles, who found themselves just above the relegation zone of the bottom three teams after a third of the season had been played. Enter COVID to once again shine on Versailles and end the season very prematurely, this time with no promotion or relegation taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following season, the season of 2021-2022, was the stuff of fairy tales for Versailles. The team started off with many draws, and I was nervous, wondering if this season might be a reproduction of the previous season. Despite the team only being in the middle of the table, I noted after about a quarter of the season had transpired, that Versailles had already played all of the teams above them in the table without losing a match, and that they would have a series of games against the bottom half of the table. The team took advantage of this run to go on a bit of a winning streak. At the same time that this was happening, the team as competing well in the Coupe de France, getting favorable picks for their opponents, and winning their games, though often by close margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the league, Versailles pushed to the top of the table and took advantage of lapses by other teams to never give up that place. They finished the league in first place by a comfortable margin, earning back-to-back promotions in seasons that were eligible for promotion. The Coupe de France was the real publicity stunt, as Versailles beat Toulouse, a team from Ligue 2, two divisions above them, in a run up to the semi-final, where they finally lost to Nice, from Ligue 1, after not giving up a goal the entire first half against the team three divisions above their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Versailles is playing in the Championnat National, having moved up from the National 3 and National 2. For the next two years, in order to reduce the number of teams playing in both Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 from twenty each to eighteen each, four teams will be relegated from both. The Championnat National is relegating six of its eighteen teams in order to keep up. I have watched anxiously, hoping not to see Versailles be relegated after their incredible story up until this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, half of the season is complete, and Versailles is in first place in the league, pending a game to be played by Concarneau, one of its primary competitors. Versailles has found the league more difficult than its previous seasons, having lost a few games. And yet, the team has won six of its nine games at home. I was there for the first game of the season when Mondy Prunier scored a goal at the last second of the game against Martigues, a goal that may prove crucial as Martigues sit second in the table right now, only behind Versailles because of that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This season has been a lot of fun, and it will be interesting to see if Versailles can indeed be promoted for a third consecutive time. Even if that doesn’t happen, it will be a success to have avoided relegation and to be playing in the Championnat National, a world away from where the team was just three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">Of all the soccer teams which I support, the club team which I have enjoyed supporting the most in these past few years is FC Versailles.

Back in 2018, when the USA disapointingly failed to qualify for the World Cup, I could still watch France play. That turned out to be a great tournament to watch from France, as France went on to win the whole World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember when France won, and we went out into the center of our town and celebrated with many other people. There were cars honking everywhere, people cheering with French flags, and even some trucks with a crowd of people loaded into the back, all cheering. It was a little makeshift parade. The games that France played at the 2018 World Cup were tough matchups. They included games against Uruguay, Belgiam, Croatia, and a famous 4-3 win over Argentina to start the knockout rounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around, France has been playing well again at the World Cup, and will face Argentina once again, this time in the World Cup Final. Both teams have had relatively easy runs up to the Final, in comparison to the teams that one would typically have to face to get that far. This is in large part because of the number of important upsets we have seen in this World Cup. Morocco notably beat both Spain and Portugal to make it to the Semi Final, and Croatia knocked off Brazil to make it to the Semi Final.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France’s opponents in the group stage were Australia, Denmark, and Tunisia. Denmark was the team that everyone was concerned could threaten to beat France and make a run deep into the knockout rounds. And while it did take a late goal from Kylian Mbappé to beat Denmark, the Danes turned in a very poor World Cup performance overall, finishing last in the Group. In fact, France was already the leader of the group after just two games, with little chance to be overtaken. It was in this way that the French team rested many of their best players in the final game against Tunisia, and ended up losing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, France picked up their form in the knockout rounds with the return of Kylian Mbappé and other notable players, easily beating Poland. The next matchup was the hardest that France would face in the knockout rounds, England. The English were a team that were hoping to make it to the Final and possibly win the Cup, just like France. It was a relatively even match, and France barely won, giving up an unnecessary second penalty to the English. It was only a surprising miss on that penalty that allowed France to advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France took down Morocco next, and is now up against Lionel Messi and Argentina. This will be another tough match for France, as Messi has established himself well in this tournament. This is probably his last chance to win a World Cup with Argentina and thus establish himself as the greatest Argentinian player, and possibly greatest player period, of all time. Despite that, France has a very good team as well, and I am expecting an even match. Whatever happens, we are proud of the French team for making it to two consecutive World Cup Finals. We will be watching this afternoon, in the hopes of celebrating a second consecutive World Cup win.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">One of the many perks of living abroad is that I can support multiple countries, such as both the USA and France.

Every American fan has been looking forward to putting the failure of the 2018 qualification campaign behind them, and to start anew with a young team looking to qualify for the world’s most important soccer tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually think that in some ways the qualification process is just as, if not more, fun than the actual World Cup. This is mostly because there are more teams competing, and the qualification phase lasts longer. This makes for pretty interesting discussion. Therefore it was a lot of fun to see Canada master their qualification campaign, never losing a match. The USA also played well, beating out rivals Mexico at home, and playing well at Azteca Stadium in a scoreless draw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USA qualified on the final day, though not without losing their final match to Costa Rica, and finishing in third place, behind both Canada and Mexico. From there, the American team played in the CONCACAF Nations League in June, beating Grenada, and scoring late in El Salvador to earn a draw. Though these matches were not against teams that would be playing in the World Cup, the USA got an opportunity to play teams at that level in September, facing off against Japan and Saudi Arabia in a pair of friendly matches. Unfortunately, neither game was a success, with a loss to Japan and a draw against the Saudis being the final matches the team would play before playing in the World Cup. The hopes of American fans were slightly diminished heading into the all-important first match against Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that match, I rejoiced as I watched Christian Pulisic play a great ball in on goal for Timo Weah, who finished his chance and put us up 1-0 over the Welsh. I later despaired as I watched Gareth Bale convert a penalty kick to even the game up. We failed to close the door on the Welsh, and we left ourselves a lot of work to do to get out of the group phase, which was our goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our second match, we faced a strong opponent in England. Oddly enough, because of the way the math worked out, it would not have been a big deal if we lost the match. Therefore I was surprised to see us put out our best players to start the match, and even more surprised to watch us play just as well as the English, if not better. It was a good feeling to avoid losing to England, keeping alive our streak of never losing to England in a FIFA World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our final group match was Iran. It was win, or go home. Iran had beaten Wales in the final minutes of the match, and only needed a draw to advance. We would have to score a goal on a team that could afford to play as defensively as possible if they liked. It was a great game, with lots of energy and emotion. Christian Pulisic showed his quality and leadership, sacrificing his body to get the ball across the goal line and put us up 1-0 near the end of the first half. We were able to hold on, and beat Iran, advancing out of the group and on to the Round of 16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next match didn’t go so well. We were up against the Netherlands, a team that many saw as a weaker team than the likes of some of the best teams in the tournament. They were a pretty good side nonetheless. In the game against the Dutch, we seemed worn out after having fought hard for our advancement out of the group stage. We had our chances, but weren’t able to capitalize. The Netherlands punished us for defensive mistakes, and beat us 3-1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of Americans happy with our performance in the tournament, but talking about how we’re gunning for a semifinal finish or better in the 2026 World Cup, which we are co-hosting with Mexico and Canada. Personally, I’m not ready to talk about 2026 yet, and I think that we have a lot to be proud of in advancing out of our group, which is something plenty of teams failed to do, including every other team from North America, as well as some of the best teams in the tournament, such as Belgium, Germany, and Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This World Cup was a reassuring moment for the USA. We showed that we belong at the World Cup, and that we belong in the list of the best 16 teams in this tournament. Obviously, getting to the quarterfinals would have been amazing, but it is still gratifying to see us consistently getting to the Round of 16 (excluding 2018, when we didn’t qualify). There are a lot of reasons to look forward to the future of this team and of this sport in USA.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Follower, Husband, Father, Explorer&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;contact@sterlingcoleman.com&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/Belteshazzar89&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/sterlingcoleman&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-reddit&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://reddit.com/user/Belteshazzar89/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-steam&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/id/belteshazzar89&quot;}]}</name><email>contact@sterlingcoleman.com</email></author><summary type="html">For a long time, I, along with many other American soccer fans, have been watching anxiously as the USA has gone through the qualification phase for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

Over the past week, the large parking lot near the local high school has been filling up with recreational vehicles of all types as well as some big trucks, as the group which is putting on the Fête du Muguet came into town to start setting up for the festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Muguet is a lily, and the Muguet Festival is the springtime festival, probably the biggest festival of the year in Rambouillet. There are more events going on than I could even mention, but the main ones which I know of are the parade, topped by the Queen, a local girl chosen every year, I believe by a vote. And of course, there is the carnival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The carnival takes up the streats all around the central portion of the large park at the Château de Ramobouillet. There are many stands to buy crêpes, coffee, cotton candy, slushies, and other snacks. There are numerous stands to try your luck at winning a PlayStation 5 by performing some sort of impossible challenge, as well as other, easier challenges with smaller prizes. There are bumper cars and many rides which whirl the riders around in various dizzying patterns, all with similar results. Near the town hall there is a swinging ship ride as well as a ridiculously tall version of the pendulum ride wtih just a few people screaming their heads off as they twist and turn in their seats, as their seats reach a hundred meters up in the air before swinging back down to ground level and up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, we are thankfully in the small child phase for another year or two. We send our children to the gentle rides. We haven´t had this festival for the past couple of years due to the COVID pandemic, but same as a few years ago, the favorite is still the multi-level jungle gym. The best one was a jungle-themed tower, three stories high, with a big spiral slide. It’s a perfect ride for us, as we can send our childen inside, and tell them not to come out until they are ready to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a good thing that our children spent almost an hour in the jungle gym over the couse of the weekend, as each entry is six euros. I realize that the people running the carnival need to turn a profit, but every time we go to this event, I can’t help wondering how much money we will have to spend before we can leave. Ten euros lasts about five minutes if two people go on one of the bigger rides. Of course, it was worth it to watch my wife screaming as she whizzed around in an oval for awhile, but still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly, the disappointing thing is that as a parent of small children, we will always be subjected to a tantrum when it is time to leave, no matter how much fun has been had. As we walk around the rides, the overwhelming number of teenagers reminds us that someday we can just send our children to the carnival without us, and they can enjoy what appears to be the big social outing of the year to put their arm around someone and buy win an oversized teddy bear.
