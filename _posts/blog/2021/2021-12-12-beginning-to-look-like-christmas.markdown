We're well into December now, and the Christmas season is starting to really show itself. I've been busy with other projects, but now I'm starting to get excited for the Christmas festivities which are starting up.

Although we would love to be with extended family during the holidays, the way that schedules worked out this year had us traveling back to the States in the summer, so we decided to have our Christmas just together as our little family unit. For a long time, I figured that we would just have Christmas at our house, like we did last year. Then, at the last minute, I was able to schedule a short trip to Luxembourg for Christmas! We can't wait to see another European country, even if it's only for a few days.

Of course, with the Christmas season comes a lot of work. Getting gifts is fun when you know just what to get, but when you are searching and searching without finding something that makes sense as a good gift, it can be quite frustrating. Thankfully, many of the gifts that I found this year came rather naturally. It always feels good to come up with something that isn't just a generic gift. Hopefully the things I've picked out will be well received.

In addition to the gift preparation, there is also just the general atmosphere, which is probably the best part of Christmas. This year, it's all about Christmas music for us. My wife and daughter have both been enjoying playing the piano, so naturally come December, our house has been full of Christmas music, which is wonderful. Between that, and listening to some of the old-time classics that I used to hear around the house at Christmastime when I was younger, our Christmas Spirit is high.

Overall, we're just happy to have another holiday to celebrate as a family. It's always fun to do things with other family, but it is also important for us to create our own holiday environment, and build our own traditions. Since we find ourselves doing that this year, we've decided to enjoy it.
